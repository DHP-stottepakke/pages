## Acknowledgement and ownership of content

Contributors will be shown at the bottom of each page and on the main [contributors page](pages/contributors) if listed in the metadata of the markdown file. We strongly suggest to add the name, ORCID, email address and/or GitHub account and affiliation of the contributor to the [CONTRIBUTORS file](https://github.com/DHP-stottepakke/pages/blob/main/_data/CONTRIBUTORS.yml).

No single contributor or editor owns the site's content or has the right to dictate what the content should be. The content on the **plan.research-data.no** is community-led, with many people contributing to each section. Hence, decisions are driven by consensus among the contributors and editors.

Since content is periodically updated, others may change your contribution without notifying you. However, the **plan.research-data.no** editors ensure that content is only modified for good reasons, ensuring that all legitimate concerns and different points of view are accommodated and that the content reflects the most popular consensus on any given topic.

If you find any content unsatisfactory, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/DHP-stottepakke/pages/issues/new/choose) about it.
