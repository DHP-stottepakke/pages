Some of the terms used in the context of data management plans and research data managment might need explanation. We try to adhere to the following definitions.

For Norwegian translations, take a look a the [NO-RDA Termliste for forskningsdatahåndtering](https://www.openscience.no/en/node/3544).

## Key research data management terms explained (alphabetical order, non-exaustive)

### Archiving, Data archival

### Data preservation

Persistent identifier: Long-lasting digital reference to an object that gives information about that object regardless of what happens to that object. Developed to address link rot, a persistent identifier can be resolved to provide an appropriate representation of an object whether that object changes its online location or goes offline.

Examples:
* [Digital Object identifier (DOI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier "2024-09-09")
* [Handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System "2024-09-09")
* Persistent URL (PURL)
* Compact identifiers for life sciece data resolving via [identifers.org](https://identifiers.org/)
