It is beneficial to take research data management into consideration already ahead of starting a research project, particularly if applying for external funding. Early identification of aspects that may need attention or potentially time-consuming processes, will avoid delays in the project progress. Furthermore, costs related to data management efforts are considered eligible costs by many research funders. Some funders therefore ask to briefly outline data management as part of project proposals.

Answering the guiding questions can be seen as preparation for writing a more comprehensive data management plan (DMP) when starting on the project.

Do you know who you can approach with questions related to research data management? Perhaps data stewards or research advisors at your unit? For institutional support, which is often located at the library, and domain-specific support services see [Get local/disciplinary support](/pages/support_00_local_disc).

## Guiding questions pre-start/ pre-award

### Data management requirements

#### Data sharing requirements and conventions
Both institutions and research funders set requirements for research data management and sharing of research data. Furthermore, many research journals require that data underlying scientific articles is made available. In addition, there can be disciplinary conventions on how data should be shared with the community.\
Discuss briefly which data sharing policies, guidelines or conventions may apply for the project.

#### Legal and ethical aspect awareness
Discuss briefly if there are legal or ethical aspects in the project that may require attention.\
Examples: Collecting/processing of personal data, obtaining consent from human participants, medical research, indigenous data governance, protection of cultural heritage, research on endangered species, intellectual property rights, confidentiality/commercial issues, export control.

In multi-partner projects, data ownership and responsibilities should be formalized. In international projects, the applicable legislation needs to be specified.

##### Legal or ethical aspects that may need attention
Some processes require early planning, have implications for data management and may be time-consuming. Not addressing them early enough may come with a risk of delaying or affecting the research project.

Is one of the following processes relevant?
* Consortium agreements
* Intellectual Property Rights
* Joint controllership agreement
* Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
* Ethical approval
* Informed consent from human participants (health research)
* Explicit consent from human participants

#### Information security awareness
Information is commonly classified into the following categories: open (green), restricted (yellow), confidential (red), strictly confidential (black). If not all data in the project classifies as open (green), information security must be considered at all project stages.

Please indicate the highest expected information security class in the project.
* Open (green)
* Restricted (yellow)
* Confidential (red)
* Strictly confidential (black)

### Making data available

#### Identifying data
Briefly discuss what data the project will collect or generate.

Remember that the research data is a broad term and includes all sorts of data used in research including observational and experimental data, surveys, registry data, simulations, and other data records. Also related project results such as research software/code should be included.

#### Can all results be made available?
Some datasets cannot be made publicly available. Decisions to not share data should follow the principle "as open as possible, as closed as necessary". Reasons may include protection of sensitive data, export control regulations, and intellectual property rights/confidentiality issues.

If data cannot be made available openly, consider if datasets still could be made available with restricted access.

#### Who else could be interested in using the data?
What application for your data inside or outside your own research field can you foresee? In short: why is your data valuable?

### Resources and responsibilities

#### Who will be responsible for data management?
Will there be one/several dedicated person(s) taking care of research data management (RDM) in the project?

If the project plans to recruit or train dedicated staff, related costs should be included in the project budget.

#### Research data management costs
Will research data management (RDM) in the project require additional resources? Consider costs for data storage, data processing, data archiving, expert support.

Many research funders consider list research data management as eligible costs in applications. Have costs for RDM been included in the project budget?
