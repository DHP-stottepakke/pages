It is beneficial to take research data management into consideration already ahead of starting a research project, particularly if applying for external funding. Early identification of aspects that may need attention or potentially time-consuming processes, will avoid delays in the project progress. Furthermore, costs related to data management efforts are considered eligible costs by many research funders. Some funders therefore ask to briefly outline data management as part of project proposals.

Do you know who you can approach with questions related to research data management? Perhaps data stewards or research advisors at your unit? For institutional support, which is often located at the library, and domain-specific support services see [Get local/disciplinary support](/pages/support_00_local_disc).

## Research data management in grant proposals
Are you expected to address open science practices and research data management already in your grant proposal?
You are not required to have a complete DMP at this stage. However, you can demonstrate that you have reflected on making your research results available.\
Some aspects that could be addressed in this section:
* What data the project will reuse, produce or generate and who could be intersted in using them (e.g. researchers from the same or another discipline, public administration, industry)
* How making data available will benefit the impact, and is connected to the dissemination and exploitation strategy of the project
* Familiarity with relevant guidelines
* Outline how data management in the project will be organised and who will be responsible
* Awareness of possible challenges or constraints particularly if handling large amounts of data or sensitive data
* Remember to include costs related to data mangement in your budget, if applicable

Since 2023, The Research Council of Norway has incorporated assessment of Open Research under two subsection of the 'impact' criterion.
* [The Research Council of Norway: Assessment of open science in grant applications](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/processing-grant-applications/processing-applications/assessment-open-science/ "2024-09-09")

In Horizon Europe, Open science practices are considered in the evaluation of proposals under the 'excellence' and under the 'quality and efficiency of implementation' criterion.

## Data management considerations pre-start/ pre-award
Beyond addressing Open Science and research data management in a grant proposal, answering the guiding questions on data management considerations pre-start/ pre-award can raise awareness for research data management aspects in planned projects that may need attention and thereby help with identifcation of challenges that could delay the project. Answering the questions during the planning phase can be seen as preparation for writing a more comprehensive data management plan (DMP) when starting on the project.

### Data management requirements

#### Data sharing requirements and conventions
Both institutions and research funders set requirements for research data management and sharing of research data. Furthermore, many research journals require that data underlying scientific articles is made available. In addition, there can be disciplinary conventions on how data should be shared with the community.\
Discuss briefly which data sharing policies, guidelines or conventions may apply for your project.

Relevant policies and guidelines:
* Institution: [NTNU Policy for Open Science](https://www.ntnu.edu/policy-for-open-science "2024-07-17")
* Institution: [UiB Policy for Open Science](https://www.uib.no/en/foremployees/142184/university-bergen-policy-open-science "2024-07-17")
* Institution: [UiO Policies and guidelines for research data management](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data-management/policies-guidelines.html "2024-07-17")
* Institution: [UiT Principles and guidelines for managment for research data](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=729171#mod_729184 "2024-07-17")

* Funder: [Horizon Europe provisions on Open Science](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en "2024-07-17")

#### Legal and ethical aspect awareness
Discuss briefly if there are legal or ethical aspects in the project that may require attention.\
Examples: Collecting/processing of personal data, obtaining consent from human participants, medical research, indigenous data governance, protection of cultural heritage, research on endangered species, intellectual property rights, confidentiality/commercial issues, export control.

In multi-partner projects, data ownership and responsibilities should be formalized in contracts or collaboration agreements. In international projects, the applicable legislation needs to be specified.

##### Legal or ethical aspects that may need attention
Some processes related to legal and ethical aspects in a research project require early planning, have implications for data management and can be time-consuming. Not addressing them early enough may come with a risk of delaying or affecting the research project.

Are one or several of the following aspects relevant?
* Consortium agreements or collaboration agreements
	* For help with contract-related questions contact legal advisors at your institution.
* Intellectual Property Rights (including planned patenting, commercialization)
	* For help with IPR aspects contact your local technology transfer office.
* Processing of personal data
* Data processor agreement or joint controllership agreement
* Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
	* For help with processing of personal data contact your local data protection officer (DPO).
* Ethical pre-approval (if e.g. conducting medical and health research, animal experiments)
* Informed consent from human participants (medical and health research)
* Explicit consent from human participants

See guidance on the DMP chapter [Legal and ethical aspects](/pages/support_03_legal_ethics) for additional information and links to institutional resources.

#### Information security awareness
Information is commonly classified into the following information security categories: open (green), restricted (yellow), confidential (red), strictly confidential (black). If not all data in the project classifies as open (green), information security must be considered at all project stages. Being aware of information security requirements helps identifying the correct storage solutions during the active phase of the research project and aids early planning for making project results available (openly or with restricted access). Institutions commonly have a storage guide giving examples and indicating which data can be stored where.

Please indicate the highest expected information security class in the project.
* Open (green)
* Restricted (yellow)
* Confidential (red)
* Strictly confidential (black)

See guidance on the DMP chapter [Storing and protecting data during the project](/pages/support_04_store_protect) for additional information and links to institutional resources.

### Making data available

#### Identifying data
Briefly discuss what data the project will collect or generate.

Remember that the research data is a broad term and includes all sorts of data used in research including observational and experimental data, surveys, registry data, simulations, and other data records. Also related project results such as research software/code should be included.

#### Can all results be made available?
Some datasets cannot be made publicly available. Decisions to not share data should follow the principle "as open as possible, as closed as necessary". Reasons may include protection of sensitive data, export control regulations, and intellectual property rights/confidentiality issues.

If data cannot be made available openly, consider if datasets still could be made available with restricted access.

#### Who else could be interested in using the data?
What application for your data inside or outside your own research field can you foresee? Will other researchers, public administration or industry be able to (re)use your results? In short: why is your data valuable?

### Resources and responsibilities

#### Who will be responsible for data management?
Will there be one/several dedicated person(s) taking care of research data management (RDM) in the project?

If the project plans to recruit or train dedicated staff, related costs should be included in the project budget.

#### Research data management costs
Will research data management (RDM) in the project require additional resources? Consider costs for data storage, data processing, data archiving, expert support.

Many research funders consider list research data management as eligible costs in applications. Have costs for RDM been included in the project budget?
