## About this chapter
Data processing and analysis is a central element in the research process and part of the data lineage/provenance. This chapter collects information about tools and infrastructure used as well as asking to clarify steps that will be important for preparation of high-quality FAIR data.


## Question-specific guidance

#### Do you need to work together with your collaborators on documents? (e.g. manuscripts)


#### Do you need a shared space with your collaborators to work on data analysis?

#### Do you need to plan compute solutions and capacity?

#### Will the data be converted to other file format(s) before archiving?

#### Will data processing or analysis alter metadata or produce additional metadata?

#### Will data processing affect information security?

#### Will you handle different versions of files?

#### Will you monitor data integrity once it has been collected?

#### Will you be integrating or linking data from different origins or different types of data?

#### Does your computational approach require validation of results?
