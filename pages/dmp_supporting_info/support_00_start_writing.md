### Choose the right template for your project
To accommodate different project needs, the questionnaire consists of different modules that can be combined and there are 5 standard variants of the DMP questionnaire. Select the variant that fits your project best:
* **Science Europe/RCN and ELSI** is a comprehensive questionnaire for projects with external funding and/or external partners. Handling of sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application can be addressed or marked as not relevant to the project. This questionnaire is meeting the requirements of research funders such as the Research Council of Norway or Horizon Europe.
* **Science Europe/RCN and HPC** is a variant adapted to computationally demanding projects yet not handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application.
* **Science Europe/RCN and ELSI and HPC** is a variant including questions on handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application and questions for computationally demanding projects.

* **Minimum questionnaire** covers a core set of questions adapted to less complex projects (e.g. student projects). It is suited for projects without external funding, external project partners, not handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application, and not computationally demanding or handling large data volumes.
* **Minimum and ELSI** combines the **Minimum** questionnaire with questions on handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application.

For other combinations or specific needs (e.g. writing an 'umbrella DMP') or transferring answers from one questionnaire to another questionnaire variant, contact [support staff at your institution](/pages/support_00_local_disc).

### Fill out the questionnaire
Filling out the questionnaire is done in three steps:
1. Choose the project phase. Initial DMP (the first version), Midway DMP (revising the DMP and adding more information), and Complete DMP(concluding the project and reporting results).
2. Select the chapter. There are 9 DMP chapters focussing on different aspects. It is recommended to fill them out in a chronological order.
3. Answer the questions. The navigation bar to the left can be used actively to jump between questions without scrolling. For additional information, the links in the questionnaire lead to the question-specific [Supporting Information for Users](/pages/dmp_supporting_info/).

There is different types of questions:
* Free-text or values (e.g. numerical, url, date)
* Multi-choice: select one or several choices
* Options: select one option and answer follow-up questions, if the exist. Use "Clear answer" to remove choice. Follow-up questions can be collapsed.
* List of items: click "+Add" for any new item. Items with their follow-up questions can be collapsed by clicking on the v arrow symbol, if several items are present they can be simultaneously collapsed or expanded. Item order can be changed and the bin symbol deletes an item.
* Item-select: refer to an item in another question by selecting it from the drop-down menu. This requires that the original question is filled out.
