## Get started with writing your Data Management Plan in Data Stewardship Wizard
After logging in for the first time, you will have to start by creating a project. Simply said, the different plans you have worked on for your research projects over time are listed as “projects” in DSW. So, projects are equivalents to plans that you are working on. Please start by creating a new project (plan), and use a good title for later revisions.

Projects/ planning drafts are auto-saved, see under “Projects” – last edited. Management of your plans, editing, revisions, exports – it all starts here. You can think of it as a set of documents, simplified. 

Your planning process will be guided by a set of questions that you answer in your plan/ project. And when beginning to set up your plan, you can therefore choose between different forms/questionnaires that all will have a defined set of questions that will be used in your planning process. 


### Choose the right template for your project
To accommodate different project needs, the questionnaire consists of different modules that can be combined and there are four standard variants of the DMP questionnaire.\
Project templates are prepared projects with knowledge models, question tags, and document templates setup, so you don't have to start from scratch. Select the questionnaire variant that fits your project best.

For externally funded projects:
* **Science Europe/RCN and ELSI** questionnaire is a comprehensive questionnaire for projects with external funding and/or external partners. Handling of sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application can be addressed or marked as not relevant to the project. This questionnaire is in line with the Science Europe DMP guidance and thus meeting the requirements of research funders such as the Research Council of Norway or Horizon Europe.
* **Science Europe/RCN and ELSI and HPC** is a variant with additional questions for computationally demanding projects.

For less complex projects:
* **Minimum** questionnaire covers a core set of questions adapted to less complex projects (e.g. student projects). This questionnaire is suited for projects without external funding or external project partners. For less complex projects that are handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application, see below.
* **Minimum and ELSI** combines the **Minimum** questionnaire with questions on handling sensitive data or personal data or requiring ethical pre-application.

For other combinations or specific needs (e.g. writing an 'umbrella DMP') or transferring answers from one questionnaire to another questionnaire variant, contact [support staff at your institution](/pages/support_00_local_disc).\
Advanced users can customize the questionnaire within the framework of the knowledge model, select questions by tags, and configure the document template and other settings.


### Fill out the questionnaire
Find a description of the core steps below. For more detailed descriptions, see the [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrI8qYtWSBw ) and the [user guidance](https://guide.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/application/projects/list/detail/questionnaire.html) by DSW.

Filling out the questionnaire is done in three steps:
1. Choose the project phase (in the drop-down menu on top of the left navigation pane): Initial DMP (the first version), Midway DMP (revising the DMP and adding more information), or Complete DMP(concluding the project and reporting results).
2. Select the chapter. There are nine DMP chapters focussing on different aspects. It is recommended to fill them out in a chronological order.
3. Answer the questions. The navigation bar to the left can be used actively to jump between questions without scrolling. For additional information, the links in the questionnaire lead to the question-specific [Supporting Information for Users](/pages/dmp_supporting_info/).

There is different types of questions:
* Free-text or values (e.g. numerical, url, date)
* Multi-choice: select one or several choices
* Options: select one option and answer follow-up questions, if the exist. Use "Clear answer" to remove choice. Follow-up questions can be collapsed.
* List of items: click "+Add" for any new item. Items with their follow-up questions can be collapsed by clicking on the v arrow symbol, if several items are present they can be simultaneously collapsed or expanded. Item order can be changed and the bin symbol deletes an item.
* Item-select: refer to an item in another question by selecting it from the drop-down menu. This requires that the original question is filled out.


### Navigate the planning “workspace”/ “project space”
**View** – note that you can control what is presented in the user interface. By default, only questions desirable the chosen project phase are visible and question tags are hidden.

**Tabs** - what do they mean?
* Questionnaire: filling in the questions = defining your plan
* Metrics – showing your metrics, connected to how much of the planned is filled out (other types FAIR/openness metrics are not supported in the current knowledge model, yet technically possible)
* Preview – to preview your export (but what kind of export will need to be defined)
* Documents = the place you export of document from the solution. Currently, html and pdf are supported.
* Settings – important to set what kind of export document that is wanted for preview.
