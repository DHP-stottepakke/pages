Step 3: Answer the questions. The navigation bar to the left can be used to jump between questions without scrolling. For additional information, follow the links to the [Supporting Information for Users](/pages/dmp_supporting_info/).

There is different types of questions:

* Multi-choice: select one or several choices
* Options: select one choice and optionally answer follow-up questions. Use "Clear answer" to remove choice. Follow-up questions can be collapsed.
* List of items: click "+Add" for any new item. Items with their follow-up questions can be collapsed. Their order can be changed.
