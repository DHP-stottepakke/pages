## About this chapter

This chapter collects administrative information about the research project for which the DMP is written. In this chapter you should provide information about the project by title, start and end date, project description, and if relevant, project funding. 

## Question-specific guidance

### Project title

Provide the project title for which the DMP is written; e. g. "A really fantastic project".

### Starting date of the project / Ending date of the project

Enter the project's start and end dates. Be sure to update the information if there are any changes, such as an extended end date. 

### Project description

Providing a project description puts the DMP in context and is thus useful information for anyone reading or evaluating the DMP. 
A project description/abstract can be provided in two ways: By linking to existing information in an external source, e.g. a project description or abstract in a funder database (be sure that the link is to information openly available). Or you can enter textual project description manually (in text box).

### Did you or do you plan to apply for external project funding?

You should list all funding that enables the project or that you applied for. 
Add funder by clicking the +Add button. Start typing the funder name (in English or Norwegian) in the text box to see a list of suggestions based on the Research Organization Registry (ROR). Funder names should be added from the Research Organization Registry (ROR) when possible.
In case the funder is not found in the Research Organization Registry (ROR), type the full name and click outside the text box, and the string will be saved. 

#### Funding status

Select the funding status appropriate for the current time (Planned, Applied, Granted or Rejected) and update the information when status changes. 

#### Grant number

It will be important to provide the unique identificator for the grant while reporting your project results.
