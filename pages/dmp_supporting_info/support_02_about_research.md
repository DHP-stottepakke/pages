## About this chapter
This chapter collects administrative information about the research project for which the DMP is written. In this chapter you should provide information about the project, such as title, start and end date, project description, and if relevant, project funding. 


## Question-specific guidance

### Project title
Provide the project title for which the DMP is written and, if applicable, project acronym.

* E.g. "AMAZING - A really fantastic project".

### Starting date of the project / Ending date of the project
Enter the project's start and end dates. Be sure to update the information if there are any changes, such as an extended end date. 

### Project description
Providing a project description puts the DMP in context and is thus useful information for anyone reading or evaluating the DMP.\
A project description/abstract can be provided in two ways: By linking to existing information in an external source, e.g. a project description or abstract in a funder database (be sure that the link is to information openly available). Or you can enter textual project description manually (in text box).

### Did you or do you plan to apply for external project funding?
You should list all funding that enables the project or that you applied for. 

#### List project funding
Use the 'Add' button for adding new funding. You will be able to select a funder from the ROR research funder registry. Select the funding status appropriate for the current time (Planned, Applied, Granted or Rejected) and update the information when the status changes.

Examples of common funders as registered in ROR:
* The Research Council of Norway (id: [00epmv149](https://ror.org/00epmv149))
* Norwegian Regional Health Authorities
	* Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (Helse Sør-Øst, id: [02qx2s478](https://ror.org/02qx2s478)))
	* Western Norway Regional Health Authority (Helse Vest, id: [001212e83](https://ror.org/001212e83))
	* Central Norway Regional Health Authority (Helse Midt, id: [04t838f48](https://ror.org/04t838f48))
	* Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (Helse Nord, id: [05f6c0c45](https://ror.org/05f6c0c45))
* Norwegian foundations
	* Norwegian Cancer Society (id: [01925vb10](https://ror.org/01925vb10))
	* Stiftelsen Dam (id: [02esmmc86](https://ror.org/02esmmc86))
* European Commission (id: [00k4n6c32](https://ror.org/00k4n6c32))
	* European Research Council (id: [0472cxd90](https://ror.org/0472cxd90))
	* European Innovation Council (id: [05cx8cy07](https://ror.org/05cx8cy07)

**Grant number and Link/reference to project in funder database**
It will be important to provide the unique identificator for the grant while reporting your project results. If applicable, add a link to the project in the funders project database.

* The Research Council of Norway usually assigns a 6-digit project number which is registered in [prosjektbanken](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/)
* The Norwegian Health Regions assign grant numbers through [ihelse - forskningsprosjekter](https://forskningsprosjekter.ihelse.net/)
* EU projects are registered in the [CORDIS - EU research results](https://cordis.europa.eu/search) database
* [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai) is a commerical service collecting data from research project databases and CRIS systems, providing it e.g. to ORCID

#### Which research data management requirements does the funder set?
Specifying relevant policies or guidelines will help you recognize research data management requirements and routines to be aware of. Research funders commonly have policies or guidelines for data management, sometimes as part of Open Science guidelines (see the page on [RDM and DMP requirements](/pages/support_00_dmp_requirements#funder-policies-and-guidelines))

Please use the 'Add' button for adding any new policy/ guideline and specify the respective url.
