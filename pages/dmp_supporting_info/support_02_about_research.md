## About this chapter
This chapter collects administrative information about the research project for which the DMP is written. In this chapter you should provide information about the project, such as title, start and end date, project description, and if relevant, project funding. 


## Question-specific guidance

### Project title
Provide the project title for which the DMP is written and, if applicable, project acronym.

* E.g. "AMAZING - A really fantastic project".

### Starting date of the project / Ending date of the project
Enter the project's start and end dates. Be sure to update the information if there are any changes, such as an extended end date. 

### Project description
Providing a project description puts the DMP in context and is thus useful information for anyone reading or evaluating the DMP.\
A project description/abstract can be provided in two ways: By linking to existing information in an external source, e.g. a project description or abstract in a funder database (be sure that the link is to information openly available). Or you can enter textual project description manually (in text box).

### Did you or do you plan to apply for external project funding?
You should list all funding that enables the project or that you applied for.

Add funder by clicking the +Add button. Start typing the funder name (in English or Norwegian) in the text box to see a list of suggestions based on the Crossref funder registry. In case the funder is not found in the Crossref funder registry, type the full name and click outside the text box, and the string will be saved.

#### Funding status
Select the funding status appropriate for the current time (Planned, Applied, Granted or Rejected) and update the information when the status changes. 

#### Grant number
It will be important to provide the unique identificator for the grant while reporting your project results. If applicable, add a link to the project in the funders project database.

* The Research Council of Norway usually assigns a 6-digit project number which is registered in [prosjektbanken](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/)
* The Norwegian Health Regions assign grant numbers through [ihelse - forskningsprosjekter](https://forskningsprosjekter.ihelse.net/)
* EU projects are registered in the [CORDIS - EU research results](https://cordis.europa.eu/search) database
* [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai) is a commerical service collecting data from research project databases and CRIS systems, providing it e.g. to ORCID
