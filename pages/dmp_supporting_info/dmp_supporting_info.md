This section collects information that is useful when writing a Data Management Plan (DMP).
- [Purpose of a DMP](/pages/support_00_dmp_purpose) explains what a DMP is and why you should write one for your research project. It also gives an overview about DMP requirements from funders and institutions.
- [Get local/disciplinary support](/pages/support_00_local_disc) refers to disciplinary data management experts and data management support staff at your institution.

It is beneficial to take research data management into consideration already ahead of starting a research project, particularly if applying for external funding.
- [Considerations pre-start/pre-award](/pages/support_00_planning_considerations) provides a set of guiding questions to be considered pre-start/ pre-award.

The core section is structured according to our DMP template. For each chapter in the DMP, it contains general and question-specific guidance:
- [Get started with DMP writing](/pages/support_00_start_writing)
- [1 - About the DMP](/pages/support_01_about_dmp)
- [2 - About the research project](/pages/support_02_about_research)
- [3 - Legal and ethical aspects](/pages/support_03_legal_ethics)
- [4 - Storing and protecting data during the project](/pages/support_04_store_protect)
- [5 - Reusing or collecting data](/pages/support_05_reuse_collect)
- [6 - Data documentation during the project](/pages/support_06_document)
- [7 - Processing, analysing and interpreting data](/pages/support_07_process_analyse)
- [8 - Preserving and publishing data](/pages/support_08_preserve_publish)
- [9 - Responsibilities and resources](/pages/support_09_responsibilities_resources)

Finally, we explain relevant terminology:
- [Research data tems](/pages/support_00_rdm_terms) gives definitions of relevant terms used in the context of data management plans.
