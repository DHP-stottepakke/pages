**Why is this topic important**\\
>> Defining what data that will be analysed within your project is an important core element when designing your research project. And identifying reusable data will often be a very effective way of starting the planning of a project, and thus you should always check whether excisting data can be of relevance to your project.\\
>> Defining how project data will be collected will also help when defining data management roles and delegate data management in the project\\
>> Defining how data will be created, possivbly reused, and flow both in and out of your project, will contribute to Open Data and Open Science practices.\\

## About this chapter
This chapter describes what data that will be included in the project. This includes both datasets or records originating outside of the project, as well as data that will be collected or captured or generated or created by yourself or other project members.   

Different disciplines may use different terms to describe the data or records underlying a research project. Here, an inclusive approach is used with 'data' functioning as overarching term. Research data is a broad term and covers all sorts of data used in research. This includes observational and experimental data, surveys, registry data, simulations, as well as data in digital museum archives and other data records.

What is considered a unit/set/collection of data may be structured according to the needs of the project. Depending on the discipline and specifics of a project, a data unit may already resemble what will preserved/published as a dataset, or be a much wider category that will undergo extensive filtering or processing on the way to becoming a dataset.



## Question-specific guidance

### The project will (re)use dataset(s) or record(s) available in a repository/registry/archive
Many research projects are based on using excisting digital sources for producing knowledge. For example, existing data is used as reference, datasets can be approached with novel questions or combined, and many published datasets contain information that was not followed up in the connected research articles. Often, pre-existing sources and data will be combined with collecting or producing own data.

As many of the same considerations apply, also access to materials that are commonly referred to as 'records' or 'sources' rather than 'data' should be included here, such as material in public archives, media archives, legal resources, or large amounts of digital literature.

Not all data from conducted research within your research field will be open and unrestricted. But very often, even restriceted and closed data(sets) of relevance can be findable by reference in publications, or by searchable metadata within registers and the like.

There can of course be a number of reasons to discard the idea of reusing data in your project, like lack of relevance for excisting data etc. Taking the time to identifying such reasons (when designing your project) will most often motivate the nesessity of collecting new data both for yourself, project members and collaborators. If the idea of reusing data is discarded, funder guidelines ask for a brief description why building on existing sources is not relevant or applicable for the project.

You can consult the chapters on data discovery and existing data in e.g. the [RDMkit for life sciences, the CESSDA Data Management Guide, or The Turing Way handbook](support_05_reuse_collect#further-resources) for inspiration.

There is a number of different strategies that can be applied to identify existing datasets or records:
#### Scientific datasets
Useful approaches to identify scientific datasets:
* Data underlaying a research article or described in a data publication
	* Use literature search engines to track relevant datasets via research articles. Data access should be described in a data availability statement.
	* Data journals are an emerging journal genre
	* Some search engines have filter functions to search in data availability statements, e.g. [EuropePMC](https://europepmc.org/advancesearch).
* Datasets in relevant discipline-specific data archives
	* Where do researchers in the same field publish their data? Check data availability statements in publications or publication guidelines of relevant journals.
	* Curated research data registries that allow filtering of discipline: [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/), [fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)
* Metasearch-services for datases. Different search engines have different advantages and disadvantages, it can be useful to compare results. Often the best choice to identify data in institutional and generic archives.

#### Data from the public sector including registry data
Useful resources (non-exaustive):
* Norwegian public data are available from [data.norge.no/](https://data.norge.no/)
* [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu/en) is the official portal for European data
* [Google Public Data search](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
* Data by international organisations, e.g. [WHO Data collections](https://www.who.int/data/collections)
* [microdata.no](https://www.microdata.no/) and [sikt.no/surveybanken](https://sikt.no/surveybanken) are Sikt services to access register data and survey data, respectively
* [helsedata.no](https://www.helsedata.no) gives access to both open health data and datasets with restricted access
* Portals for national studies such as [HUNT Cloud Data](https://hunt-db.medisin.ntnu.no/hunt-db/variablelist)
* National knowledge bases such as [artsdatabanken.no](https://www.artsdatabanken.no/search) for biodiversity or [NVE map services *Norwegian only*](https://www.nve.no/karttjenester/) for geographical data

#### Data in digital archives and collections
Useful resources (non-exaustive):
* Library collections
* [arkivverket.no](https://www.arkivverket.no/utforsk-arkivene)
* [digitaltmuseum.no](https://digitaltmuseum.no/)
* [europeana.eu](https://www.europeana.eu/en)


### The project will collect data through observations, questionnaires or interviews
If relevant for your project: Describe how data will be collected through observations, questionnaires or interviews, digitalized if needed, and how data quality will be ensured.

### The project will capture data using measurement equipment
If relevant for your project: Describe how data will be collected by using masurement equipment or laboratory instruments, how experimental parameters or other relevant information are documented, and how data quality will be ensured.

### The project will collect physical samples
If relevant for your project: Describe how cross-referencing between physical samples and digital data will be achieved.


### The project will generate research software, code, computational models or simulations
If relevant for your project: Research software, computational models and simulations are related to research data as a research output, yet more dynamic. Describe all software, code, computational models or simulations that will be generated during the research project.

If writing software/models is a significant part of the research project, you can consider writing a Software Management Plan (SMP) to supplement this DMP.
* [Elixir Software Management Plan](https://smw.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/knowledge-models/smw:smp:0.0.18)

The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) RDA working group defines research software as "source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose" ([Gruenpeter et al. 2021, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5504016](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5504016)).
The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles have been adapted from the FAIR principles to fit the characteristics of software/code ([Barker et al. 2022, doi: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x), [Lamprecht et al. 2020, doi: 10.3233/DS-190026](https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026)).

### Other types of data the project will gather
If relevant for your project: What other types of documents will the project utilize or produce, which have not been captured by the previous categories?

For some projects that handle little data, this may be the only applicable category.


### Who else could be interested in us in using data from this project?
Thinking through who could be interested in the data that is used or produced in a research project, contributes to the project's impact and can motivate good data handling practices.
