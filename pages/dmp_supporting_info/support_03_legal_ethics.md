## About this chapter
National legislation, institutional guidelines and international norms have implications for the handling of research data. Both researchers and research institutions are legally responsible for complying with legal and ethical requirements.

Questions in this chapter address the following aspects:

### The research-performing organisation(s)
The research institution has an overarching responsibility for following the applicable legislation and ensuring that research ethical norms are followed. Particulary in collaboration projects, it is important to define responsibilities and document them in collaboration agreements and contracts.

In projects that process personal data and underlay the General Data Protection Regulation, (GDPR, Norwegian: [Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)), the host organisation usually is the data controller. If responsibility is shared between organisations, a joint controller agreement is required.

In projects that are regulated by the Health Research Act (Norwegian: [Lov om medisinsk og helsefaglig forskning (helseforskningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2008-06-20-44)), the host organisation acts as research-responsible entity (Norwegian: [Forskningsansvarlig iht. helseforskningsloven](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/ressurser/fbib/lover-retningslinjer/forskningsansvarlig-ihht-helseforskningsloven/ "2024-07-17")).

Research organisations commonly have policies or guidelines for data management, sometimes as part of Open Science guidelines. There may also be specific routines or processes to be followed. Identifying such policies, guidelines, or processes will help you recognize research data management requirements and routines to be aware of.


### Research Ethical Guidelines and Codes of conduct
The Act on Ethics and Integrity in Research (Norwegian: [Lov om organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid (forsknigsetikkloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2017-04-28-23)) defines responsibilities of both research institutions and individual researchers. Furthermore, it defines an advisory role of National Research Ethics Committees that provide research area-specific guidance. Health research is handled by Regional Ethics Committees.

[The National Research Ethics Committees (FEK)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/):
* [National Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (NEM)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nem/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities (NESH)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nesh/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology (NENT)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nent/)
* [National Commission for the Investigation of Research Misconduct (GRU)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/granskingsutvalget/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics on Human Remains, interdisciplinary (SKJ)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/guidelines/human-remains/)

In addition, subject-specific ethical guidelines and codes of conduct commonly apply.

Ethical considerations may affect how data will be handled and shared, therefore mapping of generic and subject-specific research ethical guidelines and codes of conduct is important.

### Ethical approvals
For certain projects, an ethical pre-approval is needed to execute the project. The approval case numbers should be referred to in the DMP. It is the responsibility of the Researcher to make sure that the project and associated data is in agreement with current legislation.

Research projects conducting medical and health research on human beings, human biological material or personal health data must be pre-approved by the Regional committees for medical and health research ethics (REK):
* [Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/rek/)
* [REK-portalen](https://rekportalen.no/#hjem/home "2024-07-17")

Research projects conducting animal experiments must seek pre-approval from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Norwegian: Mattilsynet):
* [Mattilsynet on experimental animals (in Norwegian)](https://www.mattilsynet.no/dyr/forsoksdyr "2024-07-17")

* [Animal use for scientific purposes *Norwegian only*](https://www.forsoksdyrkomiteen.no/ressurser/)


### Personal data and data privacy
As processing of personal data is followed by data management requirements, being specific about personal data is part of the DMP. It is the responsibility of the Researcher to make sure that data processing is in agreement with the national legislation and institutional policies and routines.

Personal data is any information that can be linked to an identifiable person. This includes indirect identification. If data can identify a person directly or indirectly at any stage in the research process, the processing of personal data must be in accordance with The Personal Data Act (Norwegian: [Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)), which incorporates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Norway. Any processing of personal data requires a lawful basis. Special precautions must be taken for special categories of personal data (often called personal sensitive data) containing information about racial or ethnic origin, political beliefs, religion, philosophical beliefs, trade union memberships, genetic and biometric information, health information, or sexual information.

* The Personal Data Act ([Norwegian: Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)

* [National Research Ethics Comittees: Q&A: New legislation on personal data - what does it mean for research? *Norwegian only*](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/ressurser/gdpr/)

It is a common misunderstanding that research ethics and privacy protection is the same thing, yet it is important to remember that complying with privacy legislation and conducting research ethical considerations are independent processes.

## Question-specific guidance

### Involved organisation(s)
Specifying the host institution and possible collaboration partners is important as this defines legal responsibilities and implies which guidelines are to be followed.

Please identify both the host institution and possible collaboration partners or external parties/subcontractors contributing to the project. If your project has external partners, please indicate any relevant contracts or collaborative agreements for later reference.

We use an integration with the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/search "2024-07-16") to unambigously identify institutions. In case the organisation is not registered, type the name and click outside of the text box and the string will be saved.

### Indicate relevant policies and guidelines for research data management or Open Science
Specifying relevant guidelines, policies or processes will help you recognize research data management requirements and routines to be aware of.

Identify relevant policies, guidelines or processes applicable to your project. In addition to selecting from a list of common policies, you can manually add (additional) references. Investigate for example whether your research unit has defined own guidelines.

You can select from the following list of common policies and guidelines:
* Funder: [Horizon Europe provisions on Open Science](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en "2024-07-17")

### Are additional ethical guidelines or codes of conduct relevant?
Being aware of research ethical guidelines and codes of conduct is important as ethical considerations may affect how data will be handled and shared.

### Does the project require ethical approval?
If the project involves health research, use of human biological material, testing on animals or similar, a pre-approval is likely needed to execute the project. The approval case numbers should be referred to in the DMP.

Registrations of the legal basis of procesing personal data are not the same as a research ethics assessment and should therefore not be included here, but addressed in the next question.

Read more about [Ethical approvals.](/pages//support_03_legal_ethics#ethical-approvals)

### Will any data connected to a person ("personal data") be collected/processed?
Personal data is any information that can be linked to living person. This includes indirect identification. If data can identify a person directly or indirectly at any stage in the research process, the processing of personal data must be in accordance with The Personal Data Act (Norwegian: Personopplysningsloven), which incorporates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Norway.

Even if data should be truly anonymous and is therefore not considered personal data, i.e. data collected anonymously and not linked to a directly or indirectly person at any stage of the research process, it is worthwile to document research ethical considerations connected to data collection and participant information and how anonymity of the data is ensured. If data is anonymized during the course of the research project, it is considered processing of personal data.

Read more about [Personal data and data privacy.](/pages/support_03_legal_ethics#personal-data-and-data-privacy)


#### Which institutional privacy routines apply?
Research organisations define their own privacy policies and routines that may differ from each other, it is therefore important to make yourself familiar with the applicable policies and guidelines at your institution.

##### University of Bergen (UiB)

* [Data protection/ Privacy at UiT](https://en.uit.no/om/informationsecurity#kapittel_705927 "2024-07-16")


#### GDPR considerations
As data controller, the research-performing organisation is required to maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility (GDPR article 30). The respective routines differ between institutions and it is the researchers responsibility to make yourself familiar with the requirements at your organisation. Some of the information will overlap with the data managment plan, but unfortunately an automatic information exchange between the systems ist currently not possible.

In accordance with GDPR article 35, the necessity of conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be assessed for each project. Again, routines differ between institutions.

##### GDPR considerations are registered in other system
In case you already described the processing of personal data in detail in other systems, you can refer to these registration(s). Specify the system where the respective registration system and identifier of the project registration. Questions regarding lawful processing of personal data and routines at your organisation should be directed to the respective Data Protection Officer (DPO, Norwegian: Personvernombud).

* Registration in local systems
	* [RETTE at UiB](https://rette.app.uib.no/)
* [Sikt notification form for personal data ('Sikt Meldeskjema')](https://sikt.no/en/notification-form-personal-data)
* Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

##### GDPR considerations step-by-step
These questions will guide you through relevant considerations concerning collecting/processing personal data in accordance with GDPR. Be aware that you may have to register processing of personal data in additional systems as required by your organisation.


#### How will you document study participant information or consent?
Lack of documented permission of study participants to share data is a major obstacle to making research data available and often impossible to obtain in retrospect. It is therefore crucial to include information about planned data sharing in the participant information or consent forms. Ideally, the permission should be requested in a granular way, with distinct permission to making data available. Unfortunately, finding good guidance on this topic and examples of consent forms that are adapted to European legislation is not always easy.

It is important to remember that the ethical requirement to obtain permission to data sharing from study participants is independent of the legal basis (Norwegian: behandlingsgrunnlag) for processing of personal data as required by GDPR. This difference will however not be evident for research participants.

##### Research regulated by the Health Research Act
For medical and health research projects, the requirement for obtaining informed consent from subjects is described in chapter 4 of the Health Research Act [Norwegian: Lov om medisinsk og helsefaglig forskning (helseforskningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/LTI/lov/2008-06-20-44).

Please note that the specific 'consent' under GDPR as a legal basis is not equivalent with 'informed consent' in the context of health research. For more information please consult the [Opinion 3/2019 concerning the Questions and Answers on the interplay between the Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) and the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/opinion-art-70/opinion-32019-concerning-questions-and-answers_en) of the European data protection board.

##### Research project using 'consent' as legal basis
Consent is a possible legal basis for processing of personal data under GDPR. For processing of certain types of personal data, stricter requirements apply and processing needs to be based on a condition in addition to the legal basis. Explicit consent is one such possible condition, which must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous (GDPR article 9, article 7, and recital 32).

If consent is used as legal basis for processing of personal data consider asking for permission to archive the data for the purpose of future research, and possibly also educational purposes as part of both the informed and specific consent. It is advisable to use standard consent clauses, which can be reflected with machine readable metadata.

##### Research project using 'public interest' as legal basis
Applying public interest as legal basis for scientific research projects is common and strongly recommended at some institutions. For compliance with ethical guidelines, permission to archive the data for the purpose of future research, and possibly also educational purposes should be collected and documented.
