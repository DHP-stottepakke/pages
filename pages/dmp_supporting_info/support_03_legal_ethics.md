## About this chapter
National legislation, institutional guidelines and international norms have implications for the handling of research data. Both researchers and research institutions are legally responsible for complying with legal and ethical requirements.

```
**Why is this topic important**
* Legal and ethical considerations may affect data handling and sharing
* Become aware of relevant requirements, policies, and guidelines
* Early approaching of processes, such as obtaining approvals, that can be time-consuming ensures project progress
* Collect information about relevant policies, guidelines and central documents for later reference
```

Questions in this chapter address the following aspects:

### The research-performing organisation(s)
The research institution has an overarching responsibility for following the applicable legislation and ensuring that research ethical norms are followed. Particulary in collaboration projects, it is important to define responsibilities and document them in collaboration agreements and contracts.

In projects that process personal data and underlay the General Data Protection Regulation, (GDPR, Norwegian: [Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)), the host organisation usually is the data controller. If responsibility is shared between organisations, a joint controller agreement is required.

In projects that are regulated by the Health Research Act (Norwegian: [Lov om medisinsk og helsefaglig forskning (helseforskningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2008-06-20-44)), the host organisation acts as research-responsible entity (Norwegian: [Forskningsansvarlig iht. helseforskningsloven](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/ressurser/fbib/lover-retningslinjer/forskningsansvarlig-ihht-helseforskningsloven/ "2024-07-17")).

Research organisations commonly have policies or guidelines for data management, sometimes as part of Open Science guidelines. There may also be specific routines or processes to be followed. Identifying such policies, guidelines, or processes will help you recognize research data management requirements and routines to be aware of.


### Research Ethical Guidelines and Codes of conduct
The Act on Ethics and Integrity in Research (Norwegian: [Lov om organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid (forsknigsetikkloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2017-04-28-23)) defines responsibilities of both research institutions and individual researchers. Furthermore, it defines an advisory role of National Research Ethics Committees that provide research area-specific guidance. Health research is handled by Regional Ethics Committees.

[The National Research Ethics Committees (FEK)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/):
* [National Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (NEM)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nem/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities (NESH)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nesh/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology (NENT)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/nent/)
* [National Commission for the Investigation of Research Misconduct (GRU)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/granskingsutvalget/)
* [National Committee for Research Ethics on Human Remains, interdisciplinary (SKJ)](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/guidelines/human-remains/)

In addition, subject-specific ethical guidelines and codes of conduct commonly apply.

Ethical considerations may affect how data will be handled and shared, therefore mapping of generic and subject-specific research ethical guidelines and codes of conduct is important.

### Ethical approvals
For certain projects, an ethical pre-approval is needed to execute the project. The approval case numbers should be referred to in the DMP. It is the responsibility of the Researcher to make sure that the project and associated data is in agreement with current legislation.

Research projects conducting medical and health research on human beings, human biological material or personal health data must be pre-approved by the Regional committees for medical and health research ethics (REK):
* [Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics](https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/about-us/our-committees-and-commission/rek/)
* [REK-portalen](https://rekportalen.no/#hjem/home "2024-07-17")

Research projects conducting animal experiments must seek pre-approval from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Norwegian: Mattilsynet):
* [Mattilsynet on experimental animals (in Norwegian)](https://www.mattilsynet.no/dyr/forsoksdyr "2024-07-17")
* [FOTS application portal(gitek.no)](https://asp.gitek.no/fdu/pmws.dll/Login "2024-07-17")


### Personal data and data privacy
Personal data is any information that can be linked to a physical person. This includes indirect identification. If data can identify a person directly or indirectly at any stage in the research process, the processing of personal data must be in accordance with The Personal Data Act (Norwegian: [Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)), which incorporates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Norway. It is important to remember that complying with privacy legislation and conducting research ethical considerations are independent processes, yet it is a common misunderstanding that research ethics and data protection is the same thing.

## Question-specific guidance

### Involved organisation(s)
Specifying the host institution and possible collaboration partners is important as this defines legal responsibilities and implies which guidelines are to be followed.

Please identify both the host institution and possible collaboration partners or external parties/subcontractors contributing to the project. If your project has external partners, please indicate any relevant contracts or collaborative agreements for later reference.

We use an integration with the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/search "2024-07-16") to unambigously identify institutions. In case the organisation is not registered, type the name and click outside of the text box and the string will be saved.


### Indicate relevant policies and guidelines for research data management or Open Science
Specifying relevant guidelines, policies or processes will help you recognize research data management requirements and routines to be aware of.

Identify relevant policies, guidelines or processes applicable to your project. In addition to selecting from a list of common policies, you can manually add (additional) references. Investigate for example whether your research unit has defined own guidelines.

You can select from the following list of common policies and guidelines:
* Funder: [Horizon Europe provisions on Open Science](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en "2024-07-17")

#### Are additional ethical guidelines or codes of conduct relevant?
Being aware of research ethical guidelines and codes of conduct is important as ethical considerations may affect how data will be handled and shared.

Examples (non-comprehensive):
* [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care "2024-04-22")
* [The TRUST Code – Global Code of Conduct for Equitable Research Partnerships](https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/ "2024-04-22")
* [Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit-Sharing](https://www.cbd.int/abs/default.shtml "2024-04-22")
* [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai "2024-04-22")

Further information:
* [Ethical aspects (RDMkit): How can I identify regulations, guidelines and laws connected to ethics in my research context?](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/ethics#how-can-i-identify-regulations-guidelines-and-laws-connected-to-ethics-in-my-research-context)
* [RDM resources in Norway (RDMkit): Relevant ethical guidelines](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/no_resources#relevant-ethical-guidelines)


#### Does the project require ethical approval?
If the project involves health research, use of human biological material, testing on animals or similar, a pre-approval is likely needed to execute the project. The approval case numbers should be referred to in the DMP.

Registrations of the legal basis to process personal data are not the same as a research ethics assessment and should not be included here, but addressed in the next question.


#### Will any data connected to a person ("personal data") be collected/processed?
Personal data is any information that can be linked to a physical person. This includes indirect identification. If data can identify a person directly or indirectly at any stage in the research process, the processing of personal data must be in accordance with The Personal Data Act (Norwegian: Personopplysningsloven), which incorporates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Norway.

Further information:
* [The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) on the Personal Data Act (in Norwegian)](https://www.datatilsynet.no/regelverk-og-verktoy/lover-og-regler/om-personopplysningsloven-og-nar-den-gjelder/ "2024-07-17")
* [Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (personopplysningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-38/KAPITTEL_gdpr#KAPITTEL_gdpr)

Even if data should be truly anonymous i.e. not linked to a directly or indirectly person at any stage of the research process, documenting research ethics considerations connected to data collection and participant information is worthwile.

##### Institutional resources
Research organisations define their own privacy policies and routines that may differ from each other, it is therefore important to make yourself familiar with the applicable policies and guidelines at your institution.
