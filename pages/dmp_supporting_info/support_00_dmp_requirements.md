## Institutional policies and guidelines
DMP requirements, or calls for the use of DMPs, are commonly part of Open Science policies or guidelines for research data management. Here are links to current institutional policies of Norwegian Higher Education institutions. Currently, we have only included the partners of this DMP support project in the list. For other organisations, you can find an overview in the [RDM resources in Norway (RDMkit): Support services](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/no_resources#support-services).

* [NTNU Policy for Open Science](https://www.ntnu.edu/policy-for-open-science "2024-07-17")
> All research projects must have a Data Management Plan (DMP) fulfilling the requirements of the funding bodies.

* [UiB Policy for Open Science](https://www.uib.no/en/foremployees/142184/university-bergen-policy-open-science "2024-07-17")
> All research projects lead by researchers at UiB will have a data management plan.

* [UiO Policies and guidelines for research data management](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data-management/policies-guidelines.html "2024-07-17")
> Research data shall be provided with a data management plan.

* [UiT Principles and guidelines for managment for research data](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=729171#mod_729184 "2024-07-17")
> The researcher must set up a Data Management Plan at an early phase of the project and preferably within six months after start-up.


## Funder policies and guidelines

### The Research Council of Norway
* [From 2023, Open Science is assessed in grant applications. While a DMP is usually written at a later stage, making oneself familiar with the assessment criteria is recommended.](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/financing/application-process/assessment-open-science/ "2024-09-09")

* [The Research Council of Norway: Sharing research data (webpage)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/ "2024-10-25")
> * Requirements for data management plan in projects that manage data - excerpts from the linked to webpage:
> 	* A good data management plan makes the research data easier to retrieve and understand for others, creates awareness of data security, costs and quality, makes the research reproducible and increases the potential for reuse. The data management plan should be a living document that is regularly updated throughout the life of the project.
>	* The requirement for a data management plan for projects receiving funding from the Research Council of Norway was introduced in 2018.
> 	* Projects must submit the first version of the plan when revising the grant application. An updated version is delivered together with the project's final report.
> 	* It is the responsibility of the Project Owner to approve that the plan is in line with the institution's requirements and guidelines before it is submitted.
> 	* Data management plans should, as far as possible, be public and published openly so that academic communities can better follow their peers' practices.
> 	* Based on the data management plans received, the Research Council will accept any costs for managing data as part of the operating costs of the projects we support any costs for managing data as part of the operating costs of the projects we support.

> The Research Council’s guidelines in seven headlines:
> * Research data must be stored/archived in a safe and secure manner
> * Research data must be made accessible for reuse
> * Research data should be made accessible at an early stage
> * Research data must be accompanied by standardised metadata
> * Research data provided with a license for access, reuse, and redistribution
> * Research data should be made accessible at the lowest possible cost
> * The management of research data must be described in a data management plan

(https://www.forskningsradet.no/siteassets/forskningspolitisk-radgivning/apen-forskning/nfr-policy-open-science-eng.pdf "2024-10-30")
> The Research Council will (page10):
> * encourage adherence to the FAIR principles for data and metadata resulting from Research Council-funded projects.
> * require that datasets are made accessible along with their accompanying protocols, methods, models, algorithms, software and source code.
> * take steps to ensure that direct expenses associated with making data openly accessible according to the FAIR principles are clearly identified in grant applications.
> * require that medical and health-related clinical trials involving human subjects are registered in an approved database prior to project start-up. 


### Horizon Europe
* [Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission). (2021). Horizon Europe Open Science Fact Sheet.](https://doi.org/10.2777/18252)
> * Horizon Europe will require immediate open access to all scientific publications and responsible research data management so that data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). Data will be made ‘as open as possible, but will be allowed to stay as closed as necessary’, safeguarding legitimate interests or constraints.
> * The criteria for evaluating research proposals under Horizon Europe will take into account the quality and appropriateness of the open science practices in the submitted proposals.

* [European Commission (Version 1.0, 01 May 2024). Horizon Europe Annotated Model Grant Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf "2024-09-09")
> * [page 376]:
> * Beneficiaries must submit a DMP as a mandatory project deliverable (normally within 6 months after grant signature). An updated DMP deliverable must then be produced mid-project (for projects longer than twelve months) and at the end of the project (where relevant).
> * Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it over the course of the project whenever significant changes arise.
> * The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, ensuring open access via the repository, as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.

> * Research data management (RDM) is mandatory in Horizon Europe for projects generating or reusing data. If you expect to generate or reuse data and/or other research outputs (except for publications), you are required to outline in a maximum of one page how these will be managed. Further details on this are provided in the proposal template in the relevant section on open science. [page 43]
> * Writing a DMP is part of the methodology of the project (…). DMPs are thus a key means of support when planning and conducting a research project, and, ideally, filling in a DMP should be started prior to the beginning of the project. [page 46-47]
> * A DMP should be a living document, which is updated and enriched as the project evolves. [page 47]


## National strategy on access to and sharing of research data
* [Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. (2017). National strategy on access to and sharing of research data](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/national-strategy-on-access-to-and-sharing-of-research-data/id2582412/ "2024-09-09")
> Basic principles:
> * Research data must be as open as possible, as closed as necessary
> * Research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of their potential
> * Decisions concerning archiving and data management must be taken within the research community
