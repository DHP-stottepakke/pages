## About this chapter
This chapters collects information about data storage and backup throughout the research project. Consider all digital data that you are expecting to handle in the course of the project, including working documents.

If specific solutions are chosen during data processing and analysis or preservation, this may be specified in the respective chapters.

## Question-specific guidance

### Storage guidelines
Institutions commonly have a storage guide that explains available infrastructure and which data can be stored where.

Institutional storage guides:
* [NTNU Data storage guide](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Data+storage+guide)
* [UiB Storage guide](https://www.uib.no/en/foremployees/153608/storage-guide)
* [UiO Data storage guide](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/security/lsis/storage-guide.html)
* [UiT Research data portal - Processing and storage](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=729174)

In collaboration projects there might be multiple guidelines of relevance for your project.

### Expected total volume of data in the project
It is good to estimate the total data volume as early as possible in order to budget for connected costs. You should also consider that you might produce intermediate data that also requires space.

For some domains there might be existing guides to estimate the data volume generated by instruments. (e.g. for [Life Science data: Illumina  Approximate sizes of sequencing run output folders](https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2018/01/approximate-sizes-of-sequencing-run-output-folders.html), [Publication: Numerical Compression Schemes for Proteomics Mass Spectrometry Data](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.O114.037879))

### If applicable: Will storage need change over time?

In many cases the storage needs of a project will increase with project length. Taking this into consideration will help with budgeting and reducing expenses for storage space. Also in some cases there might be a need for temporary storage of intermediate results, which do not have to be stored for longer time-frames.

### Temporarily archiving of data sets (e.g. to tape)
Temporarily archiving can be a great solution for your project if you produce very large data volumes or if the project is collecting data over a long period but will only be analysed later. Data that is 
One potential issue might be that the access time to the archived data might be longer and has to be planned.

### Storage solutions
It is important to keep track of the storage solutions used in the project. Usually this section will be populated with solutions provided in the institutional storage guide. This is also a good opportunity to reflect on the data backup from its location, potentially associated costs and whether the information security level and certification of the solution match with the stored data. 
How the members of your project access the data and how access is controlled can be crucial. The overall capacity and transfer speed of a storage solution can be critical parameters in case you have larger amounts of data.
You should also consider if a more advanced way to organise your data, such as object storage or databases might be of help for your project.

### Information security level(s) this storage solution will be used for

While the general information security levels used at Norwegian higher educational institutions are similar (green, yellow, red, black), the classification between which data falls into which category and which solution is allowed for which security level might vary. Please consult the [institutional storage guides](support_04_store_protect#storage-guidelines) for details.

### Is the storage solution associated with costs?

In case your project requires storage beyond the basic supplied level by your institution, there might be associated costs. Often it is good practise to familiarize your self with storage costs upfront, so that they can be factored into your budget. In many cases the costs will vary depending on the needs and nature of your project and potentially by funding source. If you are using commercial cloud storage also consider that traffic in and out of the system might be charged.

### Backups

If you are using institutional solutions, the institution commonly provides backup and snapshotting functionality, that allow you to restore data. This information should be provided by your IT department. It is good to be aware of the frequency and possibly limitations of these before you may need to recover data in your project.

If you are using other solutions you should check the backup routines of theses solutions or might have to implement your own routines.
If not relying on managed storage, an often suggested backup rule is 3-2-1.

Here the explanation from [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/3-2-1-rule/) [![License: CC BY-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY--SA_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
> The 3-2-1 Backup Rule in Detail
> * Three Copies of the Data: In research, this means that in addition to the original data, create at least two additional copies. This redundancy ensures that even in the event of hardware failure or data corruption, backup versions are always available for access.
> * Two Different Storage Media: It is advisable to back up the data on two different storage media. This could be, for example, a local server and an external hard drive. Using different media minimizes the risk that both copies could be lost simultaneously due to the same event (such as hardware failure). Do not rely on hard drives only!
> * One Copy at an External Location: Store this third copy at a different physical location to protect it from local disasters such as fires or floods. While cloud storage solutions are often chosen, we recommend central storage, for example, at central IT or library services of the university/institution. Because they take care of the server housing and hosting, and the backups.
>
> Example of a Backup Plan

> A research laboratory could secure its data as follows:
> * Primary Copy: Store the original data on the laboratory server with regularly maintaining and backup procedures.
> * Secondary Copy: Store a second copy on an external hard drive or a NAS (Network Attached Storage) located in another room of the building.
> * External Copy: Store a third copy in a cloud solution or a central storage.
>
> Advantages of the 3-2-1 Backup Rule
> * Security: Data is protected from loss through physical separation and redundancy.
> * Access: Researchers can access their data even if one backup medium fails.
> * Traceability: Regular backups and the ability to access older versions of the data enable quick detection and correction of errors and data corruption.
>
> What the 3-2-1 Rule Does Not Include
>
> The 3-2-1 rule does not include a backup routine. However, this is just as important because the best backup is useless if it is out of date. Automations (e.g., a cron job) on your servers are best suited for this, copying your data to the secondary storage every night. Or use central services, they already have backup plans.


### File naming and organisation
Consistent file naming and folder structures are an important part of organising data in your research project. It is critical to be consistent and to make all of your project partners following the same convention.

There are different strategies for file naming and folder structure. Please consult the chapters in e.g. the [RDMkit for life sciences or the CESSDA Data Management Guide](support_04_store_protect#further-resources) for inspiration.

### Risk evaluation

There are different risk considerations for your project you might want to carry out depending on the nature of your project. Some practises like carrying physical storage media can be associated with increased risks or violate regulation and laws. Thus project members should be informed about the risks and the risks should be mitigated where possible.
