## About this chapter

**Why is this topic important**

## Question-specific guidance

### Storing and protecting data

Which data storage guidelines will you be following?

UiB storage guide

UiO Data storage guide

NTNU Data storage guide

UiT Research data portal - Processing and storage

Enter storage guideline(s) manually

List storage guideline(s)

Name of storage guideline

Give a reference/link to the storage guideline

What is the expected total volume of data in the project?

0-99 GB

100-999 GB

1-10 TB

>10 TB

If applicable: Will storage need change over time?

Storage needs will be the same during the whole project

Storage needs are large at the beginning and will be reduced later

Storage needs are small at the beginning and will grow later

Storage needs are largest in the middle of the project

Explore storage needs

When will your raw data become available?

Raw data will come in right at the start

Raw data will come in during the project

How much of the raw data do you need to keep in the work space?

Raw data will need to stay in the work space

Raw data can be cleaned out or archived quickly

Do your raw data need to be archived?

No, it is also stored elsewhere can be recovered easily

No, it can be remeasured easily and more cheaply than archiving

Yes

Raw data do not form a major part of the storage needs

Raw data will only be loaded in the work space on demand from the primary archives

Did you plan how much intermediate data you will get during analysis and how long each step needs to be kept?

The volume of intermediate data will not be significant

A large volume of intermediate data will be in the work space

Is it possible to store intermediate temporary data on a separate (scratch) area that is not backed up?

We will use the main work space for temporary data

We can offload intermediate results to a scratch area that is not backed up

Are you sure you will not need a backup of the data stored on the scratch file systems (any scratch you use)?

No

Yes

How CSC restored 850 million temporary files

Will you have different versions of intermediate data that need to be kept?

No

Yes

If applicable: Will you need to temporarily archive data sets (e.g. to tape)?

No

Yes

Is the storage solution associated with costs?

No

Yes

Expected costs

How will data in this storage solution be organised?

A database system

Application-specific data storage

What backup solution(s) will you apply?

Automated backup will be managed by the institution

How frequently are backups executed? Are snapshots created? What is the recovery strategy?

Backup will be automated but not managed by the institution

How frequently are backups executed? Are snapshots created? What is the recovery strategy?

Manual backup

How frequently are backups executed? Who is responsible? What is the recovery strategy?

How will you do file naming and folder organisation?

I will describe this later

I can provide details on file naming and folder structure strategy

Please describe your file naming strategy

If applicable: If data is leaked, what will be the consequences?

If applicable: Risk evaluation

Did you consider the possible impact to the project or organization if information is lost?

No

Yes; the effect is small

Yes; the risk is acceptably low

Yes; we will need to work on this.
