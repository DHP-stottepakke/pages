## About this chapter

This chapter collects administrative information about the DMP itself. It makes it clear who contributes to data management in the research project and how responsibilities are assigned in the research group (e.g. between the project leader, research staff, and technical staff), which also is useful information when making data accessible. A DMP should be a living document and plans and responsibilities for undertaking DMP revisions should be noted in this chapter.
