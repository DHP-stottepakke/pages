## About this chapter

This chapter collects administrative information about the DMP itself. It makes it clear who contributes to data management in the research project and how responsibilities are assigned in the research group (e.g. between the project leader, research staff, and technical staff), which also is useful information when making data accessible. A DMP should be a living document and plans and responsibilities for undertaking DMP revisions should be noted in this chapter.

## Question-specific guidance

### DMP title
Make a title for the data management plan which makes it clear which research project it relates to, if a project has multiple plans, then add information about which part or package of the project this specific plan is for.
E.g. "Data Management Plan for AMAZING - A really fantastic project, 2020-2024"
Eg. "Data Management Plan for AMAZING - A really fantastic project, WP3 the complex data collection, 2020-2024"

### Contributor(s)
List all person contributing to both the plan and the data management in the project.

Name is written Given-name Sur-name; Eg. Niels Henrik Abel (eller skal det v√¶re invertert???)

Institutional email addresses is proffered

[ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/) are important to correctly identify researchers, if contributors do not have an ORCID they can create one for free.

Affiliations are added at an institutional level and harvested from the [ROR registry of research organizations.](https://ror.org/)

Roles should be added to specify their contribution, examples of roles are: 
*Contact Person 
*Data Collector 
*Data Manager  
*Project Leader 
*Project Manager 
*Project Member 
*Researcher 
*Supervisor 
*Work Package Leader
*Related Person or Other can be used for others who contribute in more general terms.

### This DMP is related to other DMP(s)
If the project has multiple plans and one "master plan" this field is used to show relations. Create the master plan first, and then sub-plans for the different parts with different practices for how data is organized.

### Have your made plans for revisions of this DMP?
For the data management plan to function as a project-tool, the plan should be updated as the project evolves, and changes or issues occur.
By planning for revisions and assigning responsibility for revisions you contribute to safeguarding the data collected or produces during the project.

### Have you published, or will you publish (versions) of this DMP?

You can publish the data management plan, and updates in an open repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), you then get a DOI and can easily share and refer to the plan in collaborations. Publishing a data management plan is also best practice for research transparency and open research.


For projects with information security requirements (e.g. dual use research, protection of intellectual property rights and commercial interests), the DMP itself could contain sensitive information. If applicable, the data management plan should not be published.


### Did you consult with research data management experts?
Universities in Norway normally have a contact point where you can receive guidance regarding data management:

*[NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://i.ntnu.no/researchdata)
*[University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/111372/open-access-research-data)
*[University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data-management/)
*[UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=729171)
