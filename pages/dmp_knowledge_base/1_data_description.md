<!--Science Europe question ID & title-->
## 1a - Data description and collection or re-use of existing data

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Explain which methodologies or software will be used if new data are collected or produced.
- State any constraints on re-use of existing data if there are any.
- Explain how data provenance will be documented.
- Briefly state the reasons if the re-use of any existing data sources has been considered but discarded.

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- With respect to data formats or file formats: Make data available in a file format that is accepted by your research community to enable data sharing, interoperability, and reuse, and by the repository to enable long- term preservation. When in doubt, check a couple of potentially relevant data repositories to find out what they expect, and include your findings in the DMP.
- For guidance about how to search for repositories, see 6a

### Relevant PID
- PID of reused datasets

### Interested stakeholder
- Level 3: Stakeholders interested in reuse of their research data (funders, research community etc.), Stakeholders interested in receiving data and later governance of data within their contexts (statistics database etc.)

<!--additional explanations-->
### Explanations for support staff
- Licensing conditions
- Referencing to datasets at dataset/file level (different frameworks)

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
[Collection and/or use of existing data]
- What methods or software are used if new data is collected or produced?
- How should data provenance be documented? 
- Are there any limitations related to file format, licensed software or similar for (re)use of existing data?
- Are there any reasons why existing data sources are not reused?

#### [FAIRsFAIR - sufficiently addressed](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Clearly describes or lists what data types will be generated (for example numeric, textual, audio, or video) and their associated data formats, including, if needed, data conversion strategies.
- Explains why certain formats have been chosen and indicates if they are in open and standard format. If a proprietary format is used, it explains why.
- Provides information about the estimated data volume.

<!--Science Europe question ID & title-->
## 1b - What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes) will be collected or produced?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Give details on the kind of data: for example numeric (databases, spreadsheets), textual (documents), image, audio, video, and/or mixed media.
- Give details on the data format: the way in which the data is encoded for storage, often reflected by the filename extension (for example pdf, xls, doc, txt, or rdf).
- Justify the use of certain formats. For example, decisions may be based on staff expertise within the host organisation, a preference for open formats, standards accepted by data repositories, widespread usage within the research community, or on the software or equipment that will be used.
- Give preference to open and standard formats as they facilitate sharing and long-term re-use of data (several repositories provide lists of such ‘preferred formats’).
- Give details on the volumes (they can be expressed in storage space required (bytes), and/or in numbers of objects, files, rows, and columns).

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- With respect to data formats or file formats: Make data available in a file format that is accepted by your research community to enable data sharing, interoperability, and reuse, and by the repository to enable long- term preservation. When in doubt, check a couple of potentially relevant data repositories to find out what they expect, and include your findings in the DMP
- For guidance about how to search for repositories, see 6a

### Relevant PID
none?

### Interested stakeholder
- Possibly core facility?

<!--additional explanations-->
### Explanations for support staff
- Domain conventions
- Data formats in active phase vs. long-term preservation
- Persistent file formats, lossy file formats, conversion techniques
- Calculating data volumes

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
[File types and format]
- What types of data will the project collect, produce and/or reuse? Examples of type of data can be numerical, text, image, audio, video, etc.
- What format data is data stored in when collecting and analyzing, such as .pdf, .xls(x), .doc(x), .txt, .rdf.
- On what basis are certain data formats chosen? For example, this may depend on expertise in specific formats, preference for open file formats is, standard formats accepted at data repositories, extensive use of specific formats in research communities or format given by equipment or software used.
- What is the (estimated) volume of data to be stored during collection and analysis, archived and possibly long-term preserved? This can be stated as storage space (bytes), number of objects, files, rows and columns.

#### [FAIRsFAIR - sufficiently addressed](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Gives clear details of where the existing data come from and how new data will be collected or produced. It clearly explains methods and software used.
- Explains, if existing data are re-used, how these data will be accessed and any constraints on their re-use.
- Explains clearly, if applicable, why new data must be collected, instead of re-using existing data.
- Clearly states, if applicable, that no new data will be produced or generated by the project.
