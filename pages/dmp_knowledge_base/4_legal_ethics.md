# General annotations to Science Europe guidelines
## Science Europe guidelines 4 Legal requirements, ethical requirements, codes of conduct 
* *

### 4a If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on data security be ensured?
*Personal privacy is here addressed purely from a legal perspective, if working with personal data this should also be addressed under 4c ethical issues*
- Ensure that when dealing with personal data data protection laws (for example GDPR) are complied with:
*For research there are two options for legal bases for processing of personal data, consent and general interest in research purposes, if the later is used consent is collected for compliance with ethical guidelines.*
- Gain informed consent for preservation and/or sharing of personal data.
*If consent is used as legal basis for processing of personal data consider asking for permission to archive the data for the purpose of future research, and possibly also educational purposes* 
- Consider anonymisation of personal data for preservation and/or sharing (truly anonymous data are no longer considered personal data).
 *The relevance of anonymisation will depend on the data type and other available information*
- Consider pseudonymisation of personal data (the main difference with anonymisation is that pseudonymisation is reversible).
  * Pseudonymisation is removal of names and other directly identifiable information, and follows the principle of data minimisation, removing or not collection more personal information than strictly necessary for the purpose*
- Consider encryption which is seen as a special case of pseudonymisation (the encryption key must be stored separately from the data, for instance by a trusted third party).
* Ignore this, encryption should be addressed under 3 storage and backup *
- Explain whether there is a managed access procedure in place for authorised users of personal data.
* Make sure this is addressed under storage and backup, in adition consider*


### 4b How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?
- Explain who will be the owner of the data, meaning who will have the rights to control access:
- Explain what access conditions will apply to the data? Will the data be openly accessible, or will there be access restrictions? In the latter case, which? Consider the use of data access and re-use licenses.
- Make sure to cover these matters of rights to control access to data for multi-partner projects and multiple data owners, in the consortium agreement.
- Indicate whether intellectual property rights (for example Database Directive, sui generis rights) are affected. If so, explain which and how will they be dealt with.
- Indicate whether there are any restrictions on the re-use of third-party data.

### 4c How will possible ethical issues be taken into account, and codes of conduct followed?
* *
- Consider whether ethical issues can affect how data are stored and transferred, who can see or use them, and how long they are kept.
* *
- Demonstrate awareness of these aspects and respective planning. - Follow the national and international codes of conducts and institutional ethical guidelines, and check if ethical review (for example by an ethics committee) is required for data collection in the research project.

### Relevant Norwegian guidelines/policier

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
1. How are GDPR and the Personal Data Act complied with when handling/ processing personal data?
2. Is informed consent for long-term preservation and possibly sharing of personal data used?
3. Is anonymization, pseudonymization or encryption of personal data being considered for long-term preservation and/or sharing?
4. Should a managed procedure be used for authorized access to personal data?
(Rights and legal requirements and codes of conduct)

#### [NTNU - DMP Guidance, public domain](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
If your project includes personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable person), consider using the NSD DMP tool.
 To ensure compliance with GDPR, all projects with personal data are required to send a notification form describing all relevant elements of the planned data processing to Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD)/SIKT for an assessment. (The only exception: health research projects at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.)

 All projects with personal data must perform a risk assessment before data collection begins. 
 Relevant documents:
 Collection of personal data for research projects (NTNU)

#### [UiT - DMP guidance, public domain](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=726373)
Which data will be preserved, and which will be destroyed at the end of the project?

Will (a selection of) the data be long-term preserved, and how is this decided? (According to section 4.2 in the UiT guidelines, researchers have to assess the long-term value of their data, and describe how they will be managed.)

Will the data be made openly available? If only a selection of the data will be openly available, specify which data. (According to section 1 in the UiT guidelines, research data shall be made openly available, unless considerations regarding security, personal privacy, commercial or legal issues demand limitation of access.)

Does the material contain confidential information (e.g. personal data and data with security classification) that requires special treatment and/or limits the access to the material during/after the project?]
 Why is this important? If the material contains confidential information, you must guarantee that it’s protected from unauthorised access. Contact your organization’s IT security office to make sure that data are handled correctly for their information classification level (see the paragraph above).

### [FAIRsFAIR - sufficiently addressed](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)

- Clearly indicates if personal data will be collected/used as part of the project, and, if applicable, how compliance with applicable legislation will be ensured (for example by gaining informed consent, considering encryption, anonymisation, or pseudonymisation). 
- Describes the procedure to manage access to only authorised users.

### [SND - Checklist DMP, CC BY 4.0](https://zenodo.org/records/6424769)

**Does the material contain confidential information (e.g. personal data and data with security classification) that requires special treatment and/or limits the access to the material during/after the project?**
*Why is this important?* 
If the material contains confidential information, you must guarantee that it’s protected from unauthorised access. Contact your organization’s IT security office to make sure that data are handled correctly for their information classification level (see the paragraph above).
 
**If the research project will include processing of personal data, the research subjects need to receive thorough and transparent information about the data processing. The legal basis for processing personal data for research purposes is, for the most part, public interest. This means that the researcher can process personal data, but that a data controller is required to supply thorough information about how the data are processed.**
*Why is this important?* 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates on which legal grounds personal data can be lawfully processed. One requirement is that the research subjects receive thorough information about which personal data will be processed and how they will be processed in the project. This means that the research subjects are informed about for what purpose and on what legal grounds the processing will be made. By giving the research subjects information about the personal data processing, they gain insight into and control over what information about them is processed.
 
**How will the research subjects’ identities be protected?**
*Why is this important?*
Protecting the personal integrity of research subjects (see the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) is a fundamental principle in research and an important ethical responsibility to the participants in a research project. During the project, data that contain personal information need to be securely stored, in compliance with the guidelines at your university/organization.
 Research material may also contain special category personal data that need to be classified to protect the integrity of research subjects. Therefore, it’s important to have routines for how to handle requests to access personal data in accordance with the principle of public access to information. When the project is finished and the data material shall be made accessible, it’s also important to guarantee that the individuals in the study cannot be re-identified (i.e. identified through indirect identifiers in the data material). This can be done by de-identification measures or pseudonymisation of the data, such as coding or encryption.
 
**Has the personal data processing been reported to the data protection officer, in compliance with the research principal’s policies?**
*Why is this important?*
Research material that will contain personal data has to be reported to the data protection officer. The research principal is legally obligated (GDPR, Article 30) to keep a record of all projects where personal data are processed.

#### [DMP Tuuli, CC BY 4.0](https://zenodo.org/records/5242629)
How will you manage the rights of the data you use, produce and share? (2.2) Describe how you will agree upon the rights of use related to your research data – including the collected, produced and (re)used data of your project. Here, you can employ your categorisation in the first question. Each of these categories involves different rights and licenses. Describe the transfer of rights procedures relevant to your project. Describe confidentiality issues if applicable in your project. License your data! Tips for best practices • Agreements on rights of use should be made as early as possible in the project life cycle. • Have you gained consent for data preservation and sharing? • Follow the funder's or publisher's policies. • It is recommended to make all of the research data, code and software created within a research project available for reuse, e.g., under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/), [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), or under another relevant license.

#### [SND - Checklist DMP, CC BY 4.0](https://zenodo.org/records/6424769)
[Does the project need ethical approval or has it been approved? Enter the reference number here.] Why is this important? Research that falls under the scope of the Act (2003:460) concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans (the Ethical Review Act, updated 2020-01-01) can only be carried out after ethical approval, which is applied for by the research principal. Without ethical approval, the research is illegal and subject to legal consequences. Ethical approval is also needed for research that involves animal testing.

#### [NTNU - DMP Guidance, public domain](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
Is an ethical review (for example by an ethics committee/REK or approval of use of experimental animals) required for data collection in the research project?

#### [UiT - DMP guidance, public domain](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=726373)
Are you going to collect informed consent to store and share the data? If so, how? How are you going to secure confidentiality and identity protection?

#### [SIKT, equivalent CC BY](https://sikt.no/en/data-management-plan)
Add any comments on issues related to for example: research on human embryos and fetuses, and/or human cells and tissues; collection of personal data and obtaining consent; animal research; research in non-EU countries; unintended effects on the environment, health and safety; and the potential misuse of research results.
