<!--Science Europe question ID & title-->
## 4a - If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on data security be ensured?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Ensure that when dealing with personal data data protection laws (for example GDPR) are complied with:
- Gain informed consent for preservation and/or sharing of personal data.
- Consider anonymisation of personal data for preservation and/or sharing (truly anonymous data are no longer considered personal data).
- Consider pseudonymisation of personal data (the main difference with anonymisation is that pseudonymisation is reversible).
- Consider encryption which is seen as a special case of pseudonymisation (the encryption key must be stored separately from the data, for instance by a trusted third party).
- Explain whether there is a managed access procedure in place for authorised users of personal data. 

- Comment: ensure that this aspect is covered under storage

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- For guidance on access, see 5a.

- Clearly indicates if personal data will be collected/used as part of the project, and, if applicable, how compliance with applicable legislation will be ensured (for example by gaining informed consent, considering encryption, anonymisation, or pseudonymisation).
- Describes the procedure to manage access to only authorised users.

## 4b - How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Explain who will be the owner of the data, meaning who will have the rights to control access:
- Explain what access conditions will apply to the data? Will the data be openly accessible, or will there be access restrictions? In the latter case, which? Consider the use of data access and re-use licenses.
- Make sure to cover these matters of rights to control access to data for multi-partner projects and multiple data owners, in the consortium agreement.
- Indicate whether intellectual property rights (for example Database Directive, sui generis rights) are affected. If so, explain which and how will they be dealt with.
- Indicate whether there are any restrictions on the re-use of third-party data.

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- For guidance on access, see 5a.

### Relevant PID
- FOTS ID
- REK ID

Clearly explains, if applicable:
- Who will have the rights to control access to which part of the data.
- What access conditions and re-use licenses will apply to the data.
- Clearly explains, if applicable, how intellectual property rights will be managed.
- Explains for multi-partner projects and multiple data owners how these matters are addressed in the consortium agreement.
- Alternatively, there is a clear statement that there are no such restrictions on the data.
- Indicates, if applicable, whether there are any restrictions on the re-use of thirdparty data.

<!--Science Europe question ID & title-->
## 4c - How will possible ethical issues be taken into account, and codes of conduct followed?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Consider whether ethical issues can affect how data are stored and transferred, who can see or use them, and how long they are kept. Demonstrate awareness of these aspects and respective planning.
- Follow the national and international codes of conducts and institutional ethical guidelines, and check if ethical review (for example by an ethics committee) is required for data collection in the research project.

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Explicitly state in your metadata when access to the data needs to be limited due to ethical reasons. Include information on how to request access when this is possible and mention the contact details of the rights holder.
- In case data cannot be publicly shared due to ethical reasons, make sure you do still publish the accompanying metadata.
For more guidance on licensing and access, see 5a.

- Provides details of what ethical issues have been considered that may affect
data storage, transfer, use, sharing and/ or preservation, and demonstrates that
adequate measures are in place to manage ethical requirements.
- Mentions, if applicable, whether ethical review is being pursued. If ethical approval has been obtained, refers to the relevant committee and documents.
- Refers to relevant ethical guidelines and/or codes of conduct or alternatively provides a clear statement that explains why ethical issues have not been considered.
