## General questions

### I don't have data in my project
- How about other sources in the project and how are they managed? Do they have identifiers? Are resources required? (e.g. literature, case law, database access)
- Methodology to extract information and their documentation (e.g. coding)
- The project will likely have working documents. How are they organized, named, stored, backed-up and exchanged between collaboration partners?
- Is there ethical questions or Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to be considered and documented?
- Text is data, images are data… Specific for the humanities: [10.7486/DRI.tq582c863](https://doi.org/10.7486/DRI.tq582c863)

### Who will evaluate my DMP?
Practices for DMP evaluation (first draft/as part of the final reporting) are still under establishment and routines may vary between different research funders and institutions.

In the Horizon Europe funding scheme, a brief outline of data management (1-page DMP) is required at proposal stage and included the scientific proposal evaluation.

<!--- ### Who can quality-control my DMP? -->

### Where can a DMP be published?
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an agnostic research archive (operated by CERN) which allows you to share all sorts of research outputs including data managment plans. Zenodo also allows versioning and will create a DOI for your files.

### I feel it is too much work to prepare my data for archiving in a domain-specific archive

Subject-specific (discipline-specific, domain-specific) repositories are the first choice to ensure data will be reusable in your research community, as metadata follow domain standards. Comparison between datasets or reuse at large scale (e.g. meta-analysis) is easiest if subject-specific repositories are used. [Re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) and [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) are curated registries and can help identifying suitable subject-specific repositories.

Research data repositories commonly have guides/help-pages which makes it easier for you to prepare your data before submitting them to the repository. See if the repository you are submitting to has such a guide. Familiarizing yourself with such a guide early on, such as when drafting up a DMP, makes it easier for you to plan which metadata needs to be gathered in order for you to be able to submit to your repository of choice.

### What format should I store my research data in?
You should consider a format which is common to the research discipline you are working in, which also adheres to [Open Science standards.](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats/)

### What metadata should I consider collecting in my reseach project?

If you are unsure about whuch metadata to collect, consider consulting the [The Dublin Core Metadata standard](https://www.dublincore.org/), which originally comprosed of a [collection of 15 "essential" terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-3).
If you choose to share your data in a long term archive, it is highly likely this archive has a set of guidelines, wherein the necessary metadata are described. 

<!--- ### What should be considered when writing a DMP for Citizen Science projects? -->

### Where can I find an example of how a DMP should look like?
Reading through different DMPs can be an useful exercise. Keep in mind that not all public DMPs are quality-controlled.
- [Example DMPs and guidance from Digital Curation Centre](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/guidance-examples)
- [Curated collection of Horizon 2020 DMPs from University of Vienna](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/search#?page=1&pagesize=10&collection=o:1140797)
- [DMp catalogue from LIBER Europe](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/research-data-management/plans/)
- [Public DMPs from Argos OpenAIRE](https://argos.openaire.eu/explore-plans)

### How much of the DMP should I fill out at this stage?

Ideally, a DMP should be as filled out as much as possible before the active phase of the project starts and some aspects should alreday be in place at the proposal stage. Mapping out aspects of the research life cycle as early as possible will make it easier for you to have an idea of which data should be gathered while conducting the research project. For example; deciding early on which data repository you will submit the data to for long storage will give you an idea of which metadata will be necessary to gather in order to submit to the relevant archive.

The DMP should be updated as the project develops and decisions taken, it should be considered 'a living document'. Scheduling regular updates is recommended, either at given timepoints or in connections with milestones in the project.

## Level of the DMP

I need a 1-page DMP for a Horizon Europe application.<br/>

- From the HE Programme Guide (v4.0):  
	-	p. 42: Under the ‘Excellence’ part of their proposals, in the section on methodology, proposers should describe how open science practices (mandatory and recommended, as appropriate) are implemented as an integral part of the methodology and show how their implementation is adapted to the nature of their work, therefore increasing the chances of the project delivering on its objectives. Information relevant to the specific area of the proposal should be provided in no more than one page. If open science practices are not applicable to the proposal, justifications should be provided so that, if evaluators agree, open science will not be taken into consideration in the evaluation. Additionally, proposers generating or reusing data should outline in a maximum of one (additional) page their plans for data management.
   	-	p.43: Research data management (RDM): RDM is mandatory in Horizon Europe for projects generating or reusing data. If you expect to generate or reuse data and/or other research outputs (except for publications), you are required to outline in a maximum of one page how these will be managed. Further details on this are provided in the proposal template in the relevant section on open science. A full data management plan (DMP) is not required at submission stage.(...)

## Research ethics & restrictions to data sharing

-	Is my data still personal if it has been pseudonymized and the key has been deleted/is stored in a safe system
-	My project is in collaboration with a Greek/British/US/Indian/Chinese/Iranian partner. Are there restrictions on data sharing?
-	IPR if changing institution, particularly if not part of the IPR regulations
-	How should the CARE principles be implemented in practice? Is there Norwegian resources? 


## Science Europe guideline specific:
- Science Europe guidelines require “For collaborative projects, explain the co-ordination of data management responsibilities across partners.” (Data management responsibilities and resources, 6a) - how should this be done in practice?
- Standardkontrakter omfatter ofte ikke datadeling
- GDPR-relevante dokumenter
- Science Europe guidelines require “Explain how the data will be recovered in the event of an incident.” (Storage and backup during the research process, 3b) – how should an explanation look like, who is in charge?
