## Frequently asked difficult questions

#### I don't have data in my project
- How about other sources in the project and how are they managed? Do they have identifiers? Are resources required? (e.g. literature, case law, database access)
- Methodology to extract information and their documentation (e.g. coding)
- The project will likely have working documents. How are they organized, named, stored, backed-up and exchanged between collaboration partners?
- Is there ethical questions or IPR to be considered and documented?
- Text is data, images are dataâ€¦ Specific for the humanities: [10.7486/DRI.tq582c863](https://doi.org/10.7486/DRI.tq582c863)
