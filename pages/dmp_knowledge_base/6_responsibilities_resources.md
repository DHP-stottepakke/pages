### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Determine the role of the data repository in your data management and stewardship. Choose an adequate repository to archive and share your data in that can meet or surpass your desires. Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDRs) are repositories that provide support and take responsibility for data curation and digital preservation. TDRs can be officially certified (e.g., by the CoreTrustSeal, DIN31644/NESTOR, or ISO163638 standard). Use Re3data to find certified TDRs to deposit your data in.
- *Comment for support staff: Make an effort early in the project to find a repository that is well suited, to make sure the most appropriate repository is identified.*

### Relevant PID
- ORCID to identify individuals
- CRediT for contributors roles
- PID for chosen repository/-ies
- ROR for institution (? - for responsible institution. And to map individual ORCIDs with institution?)

**Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management? (6.1)**
Summarise here all the roles and responsibilities described in the previous answers. Also, consider who will be responsible for the data resulting from your project after your project has ended.
**Tips for best practices**
- Outline the roles and responsibilities for data management/stewardship activities, for example, data capture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving, and data sharing. Name the responsible individual(s) where possible. 

**Who will be responsible for controlling access to your data, and how will secured access be controlled? (4.2)**
It is essential to consider data security issues, especially if your data include sensitive data, personal data, politically sensitive information or trade secrets. Describe who has access to your data, what they are authorised to do with the data, or how you will ensure the safe transfer of data to your collaborators.
**Tips for best practices**
- Access controls should always be in line with the level of confidentiality involved
- For collaborative projects, explain the co-ordination of data management responsibilities across partners.
- Indicate who is responsible for implementing the DMP and for ensuring that it is reviewed and, if necessary, revised.
- Consider scheduling regular updates of the DMP.

[Is personal data involved in the dataset? If so, has the personal data processing been reported to the data protection officer, in compliance with the research principal’s policies?]
Why is this important? Research material that will contain personal data has to be reported to the data protection officer. The research principal is legally obligated (GDPR, Article 30) to keep a record of all projects where personal data are processed.

#### [NTNU - DMP guidance, public domain](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
Some funders consider costs related to research data management as a legitimate addition to the project budget. Consider whether you should include costs such as these when applying for research grants and contact the financial officer at your faculty/institute.

#### [UiT - DMP guidance, public domain](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=726373)
Who has the right to manage the data? (Usually several members of the project group, but not necessarily all members. Manage means collect, structure, revise, process, etc.)

#### [EasyDMP, CC0](https://www.sigma2.no/data-planning)
**Describe who will be responsible for the management of your data**
- You should consider the roles and responsibilities (naming individuals if possible) for data management/ stewardship actvities for example data capture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving, and data sharing. For collaborative projects, explain the coordination of data management responsibilities across partners. Indicate who is responsible for implementing the DMP, and for ensuring it is reviewed and, if necessary, revised. You should consider regular updates of the DMP.

<!--Science Europe question ID & title-->
## 6b - What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862)
- Explain how the necessary resources (for example time) to prepare the data for sharing/preservation (data curation) have been costed in. Carefully consider and justify any resources needed to deliver the data. These may include storage costs, hardware, staff time, costs of preparing data for deposit, and repository charges.
- Indicate whether additional resources will be needed to prepare data for deposit or to meet any charges from data repositories. If yes, explain how much is needed and how such costs will be covered.

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Determine any costs that your chosen repository charges for depositing the data. Data repositories, especially TDRs (‘trustworthy digital repositories’) will perform (some) data curation and digital preservation. This is an active and ongoing process of data management to ensure discovery, reuse, and long-term FAIR durability. Contact the repository of your choice to learn about these costs and make them explicit in your DMP.

Costing RDM

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
[Storage and data security during the project]
- How are the necessary resources budgeted and covered in the project to prepare data for sharing and long-term preservation (curating)? These can be costs related to storage, hardware, staff time, costs associated with preparing data for disposal and costs related to preservation at a data repository.

#### [FAIRsFAIR - sufficiently addressed](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215)
- Provides clear estimates of the resources and costs (for example storage costs, hardware, staff time, costs of preparing data for deposit, and repository charges) that will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR and describes how these costs will be covered. Alternatively, there is a statement that no additional resources are needed.

**What resources will be required for your data management procedures to ensure that the data can be opened and preserved according to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)? (6.2)**
- Estimate the resources, such as time and financial costs, needed to manage, share and preserve the data. These may include storage costs, hardware, staff time, the costs of preparing data for deposit and repository charges.

**Tips for best practices**
- Consider, if there will be additional costs from computational facilities or resources that need to be accessed.
- Account for resources, time and money, needed to prepare the data for sharing it and preservation (data curation). 
- Remember to specify your data management costs in the budget, according to funder requirements.

#### [SND - Checklist for DMP](https://zenodo.org/records/6424769)
[Estimate what resources you will need to collect and document the data material during the project. This includes the cost of staff to collect, process, manage, and document the data during the project, as well as to prepare the data and documentation for long-term preservation and possible dissemination, which will improve the FAIRness of the data.]
**Why is this important?**
Handling and documenting data tends to require more resources than planned. By planning for and documenting staff costs for documentation and data management during the project, as well as for the work needed to archive and make the data accessible after the project, you are more likely to have sufficient resources.

#### [NTNU - DMP Guidance](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
The FAIR acronym points to overarching principles for data management that will enhance the potential for reusability. For more information, visit the Go FAIR website.
 
In short, you increase the FAIRness of data by
- Depositing your data/metadata in a searchable resource
- Providing all information required for users (computer or human) to read and interpret the data.
- Using available community standards for data and metadata.
- Using open formats and assigning persistent identifiers.
- Providing your data with an appropriate license
- In some cases, there will be additional costs involved in managing data in a way that promotes reuse. Examples could be costs for storage and processing of large amounts of data, or costs related to making particular data types available through repositories. For some projects, there might also be a need for a dedicated data manager or data steward. Although it might be difficult to pinpoint the exact costs, OpenAIRE has developed a data costing tool that lists elements that could be useful to consider when attempting to estimate.

#### [SIKT, equivalent CC BY](https://sikt.no/en/data-management-plan)
Note that costs associated with open access to research data may be a qualified part of the research grant. This applies, for example, for Horizon 2020 projects (if otherwise in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement).

#### [EasyDMP, CC0](https://www.sigma2.no/data-planning)
**Describe the resources that will be dedicated to the management of your data such that it follows the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles**
- You should consider the resources (time, personnel, money) necessary to preserve and share the data. You should cover where the resources will come from.
