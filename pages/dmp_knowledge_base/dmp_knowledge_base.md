This section collects useful information about data management plans (DMP) for support personnel.

The project work included conceptual reflections in DMP which we would like to share:
- [Conceptual DMP reflections](/pages/dmp_reflections)

The core part of the knowledge base is based on the [Science Europe DMP Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862 "Science Europe. (2021). Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management - Extended Edition. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862"). Each section is annotated and mapped to relevant persistent identifiers, interested stakeholders, project phase, and the [RDA Common Standard for machine-actionable DMP (maDMP)](http://doi.org/10.15497/rda00039).

Annotations by the project group are indicated as follows:
> 1a.1\
> Guidance text

Annotation by project group.

Furthermore, each section is complemented by more extensive explanations and the [DMP guidance from the Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/), the [DMP template provided by Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/reference-documents?selectedProgrammePeriod=2021-2027&selectedProgramme=HORIZON), the[FAIRsFAIR FAIR-Aware Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215). Provided information and annotations are specific to jurisdiction, stakeholders, and guidance documents in Norway. Policies highlight partners in the 'DHP st√∏ttepakke' project at the current stage.\
As part of the working process, each section also contains guidance texts for researchers from specified sources, and an overview over aspects that will require further explanations for DMP users.
