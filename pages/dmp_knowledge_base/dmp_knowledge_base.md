This section collects useful information about data management plans (DMP) for support personnel.

The core part of the knowledge base is an annotation of the DMP guidance by Science Europe:
- [Science Europe DMP Guidance - annotated](/pages/science_europe)

Furthermore, the project work involved conceptual reflections on DMPs which we would like to share, as well as mapping RDM policies and DMP requirements:
- [Conceptual DMP reflections](/pages/dmp_reflections)
- [Requirements and policy documents](/pages/dmp_policy)

The knowledge base is complemented by the following topics:
- [Frequently asked difficult questions](/pages/difficult_faq)
- [Research Data Management terminology (NO-EN)](/pages/rdm_terminology)
- [DMP training resources](/pages/dmp_training)
