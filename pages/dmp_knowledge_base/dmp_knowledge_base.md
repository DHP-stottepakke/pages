This section collects useful information about data management plans (DMP) targeting personnel in support roles.

The core part of the knowledge base is an annotation of the DMP guidance by Science Europe:
- [Science Europe DMP Guidance - annotated](/pages/science_europe)

Furthermore, the project work involved conceptual reflections on DMPs which we would like to share, as well as mapping RDM policies and DMP requirements:
- [Conceptual DMP reflections](/pages/dmp_reflections)
- [Requirements and policy documents](/pages/dmp_policy)

The knowledge base is complemented by the following topics:
- [Frequently asked difficult questions](/pages/difficult_faq)
- [Research Data Management terminology (NO-EN)](/pages/rdm_terminology)
- [DMP training resources](/pages/dmp_training)
