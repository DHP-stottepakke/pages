This section collects useful information about data management plans (DMP) for support personnel.

The page structure is based on the [Science Europe Core Requirements](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862 "Science Europe. (2021). Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management - Extended Edition. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862"), with annotations added to the Science Europe DMP template based on the core requirements for DMPs. Furthermore, each section is mapped to relevant persistent identifiers, interested stakeholders, project phase, and complemented by further explanations and the [DMP guidance from the Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/), the [DMP template provided by Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/reference-documents?selectedProgrammePeriod=2021-2027&selectedProgramme=HORIZON), the[FAIRsFAIR FAIR-Aware Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215). As part of the working process, each sections also contains guidance texts for researchers from speciefied sources, and an overview over aspects that require further explanations for DMP users.
