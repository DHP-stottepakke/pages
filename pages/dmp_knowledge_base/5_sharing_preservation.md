With respect to licensing: Clearly and explicitly license your data, no matter which access level the data has. Find a suitable license (either standard such as CreativeCommons, or bespoke) and find a repository that supports it on Re3data. Preferably use a standard, machine-readable licence. Include the license information in the metadata.

With respect to access: Consider and define the access levels of your data early on (public, restricted, embargo, closed, or a combination). Include this information in your metadata,
including possible related conditions for reuse.

With respect to discoverability and preservation planning:
Deposit your data in a trustworthy data repository.
For guidance on trustworthy repositories, see 6a.

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
[Data sharing and reuse]
How should the data be findable and how should it be shared? Examples may be that they are made available in a certified data repository, are indexed in a catalogue, that you use a secure data service, direct handling of data requests, etc.

When should the data be shared? If, for example, an exclusive right of control granted by legal law is made that affects the time of sharing and, why and for how long? Examples may be that you wait until a scientific publication is available or that you want to protect intellectual property rights, such as patent law, until you have applied for a patent.

### Existing sources that can be reused

#### [DMP Tuuli](https://zenodo.org/records/5242629) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
What part of the data can be made openly available or published? Where and when will the data, or its metadata, be made available? (5.1) 
 Describe how you will make data available and findable for reuse. If your data or parts of the data cannot be opened, explain why you publish only metadata.
 In the case of sensitive data, which cannot be opened, describe the opening of its metadata. Describe the secured preservation procedure of sensitive data in Section 5.2.
 The openness of research data promotes its reuse.
 Tips for best practices
You can publish a description (i.e., the metadata) of your data without making the data itself openly available, which enables you to restrict access to the data.
Publish your data in a data repository or a data journal.
Check re3data.org (https://www.re3data.org/) to find a repository for your data.
Prefer repositories or publishers, which provide persistent identifiers (PID) to enable access and citation to the data via a persistent link (e.g. DOI, URN).
Remember to check the funder, institutional, disciplinary or national recommendations for data repositories.
It is recommended to make all of the research data, code and software created within a research project available for reuse, for example, under a Creative Commons (https://creativecommons.org/choose/), GNU (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or MIT license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), or under another relevant license.

[How do you plan to preserve the research material? Find out what rules your university/organization has for preservation and destruction of research records and decide who in the research team is responsible for making sure that the official records from the project are archived.
 What data will be preserved and/or made accessible, and how do you make that selection? Are there any local regulations? If it is possible to make the data accessible: when, where, and to whom? Will the data be made accessible in a data repository, a subject-specific database, at the university, or by the research group?]
Why is this important? Digital data materials need to be actively administered over time, to make sure that they remain accessible and usable. Research materials that are created at a university/public agency must be archived there, in accordance with the Swedish Archives Act (SFS 1990:782). As a rule, official documents at universities and other higher education institutions shall be archived and it is, in principle, unlawful to destroy official documents unless specifically allowed by law, i.e. if there is a right to dispose of records. Raw data files, ethical approvals, research data documentation, and published results must be archived. If you have questions regarding archiving or destruction of documents, please consult with your organization’s archive.

## 5b - How will data for preservation be selected, and where will data be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- Indicate what data must be retained nor destroyed for contractual, legal, or regulatory purposes.
- Indicate how it will be decided what data to keep. Describe the data to be preserved long-term.
- Explain the foreseeable research uses (and/or users) for the data.
Indicate where the data will be deposited. If no established repository is proposed, demonstrate in the DMP that the data can be curated effectively beyond the lifetime of the grant. It is recommended to demonstrate that the repositories policies and procedures (including any metadata standards, and costs involved) have been checked.

### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
With respect to data destruction:
Figure out early on by conferring with research data management and ethics specialists if (parts of) your data need to be destroyed (e.g., after a certain amount of time). If this is the case, include general statements about data destruction in the consent forms you use during your study. Make sure that the repository you deposit your data in can handle such destruction and will continue to maintain your metadata
afterwards.

For guidance on trustworthy repositories, see 6a.

### Existing sources that can be reused

#### [SND - Checklist DMP](https://zenodo.org/records/6424769)[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
[Before you preserve the data material and make it accessible, you may want to prepare the material. What file formats are suitable for long-term preservation? What documentation should be included with the data material after the project has ended? Are there any ethical and legal restrictions on the material, which mean that the data need to be processed (e.g. de-identified) before they can be made accessible? Where do you plan to archive and/or make the data accessible? Contact them in good time for assistance in how to prepare the material.]
 Why is this important? Digital file formats run the risk of becoming obsolete. If this should happen, future software may not be able to read and present the information in the files correctly, and valuable research data could be lost. Therefore, you should choose file formats that are more likely to remain usable in the future, i.e. formats that are commonly used, non-proprietary, and have an open technical specification. Another benefit of choosing those formats is that you won’t have to convert the file formats at the end of the project. It isn’t always possible to choose a format that meets all criteria, as specific instruments, analysis tools, or developed software can affect the choice of data formats. If that’s the case, it’s important to plan for how to guarantee that the data material can be preserved.
 When the project is finished and the data material shall be made accessible, it may, due to ethical and legal restrictions, be important to guarantee that the individuals in the study cannot be re-identified (i.e. identified through indirect identifiers in the data material).

#### [DMP Tuuli](https://zenodo.org/records/5242629)[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
**Where will data with long-term value be archived, and for how long? (5.2)**
 Briefly describe what part of your data you will preserve, where it is preserved, and for how long. Long term preservation means that data is preserved for as long as necessary, for several decades or even centuries.
 You can categorise your data sets according to the anticipated preservation period:
 A) Data to be destroyed upon the ending of the project
 B) Data to be archived for a verification period, which varies across disciplines, e.g., 5–15 years 
 C) Data to be archived for potential re-use, e.g., for 25 years
 D) Data with long-term value to be archived by a curated facility for future generations for tens or hundreds of years

You will need to decide which of your research data to preserve and dispose of. Data that is unique or difficult to replicate might have long-term value and be fit for preservation. Special long term data repositories should be used for digital preservation. 

**Tips for best practices**
Decisions about preserving data should begin during the data management planning stage, and should take into account e.g. institutional guidance and requirements.
Use data repositories with a commitment to long-term curation, e.g. Fairdata Digital Preservation Service is dedicated for research datasets that have significant value to the organization or on a national level currently and especially also in the future. Contact your home organisation for further information.

**Why is this important?**
To make it possible to continue using the data material, it’s important to enter information about what software or tools that are needed, as non-proprietary software isn’t always sufficient. Some tools may also be based on a certain software and, if possible, it’s of great help to include the software with the material, e.g. by open source code.

## 5d - How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- Explain how the data might be re-used in other contexts. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) should be applied so that data can be reliably and efficiently located and referred to. PIDs also help to track citations and re-use.
- Indicate whether a PID for the data will be pursued. Typically, a trustworthy, long-term repository will provide a persistent identifier.


### [FAIRsFAIR Additional Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
Choose a data repository to deposit your data in that assigns your desired persistent identifiers (e.g., a DOI, Handle, or ARK for the data, or an ORCID for the researchers). Use Re3data or FAIRsharing to find a suitable repository.

[Data sharing and reuse]
Will a persistent identifier (DOI) for the datasets be used? Persistent identifiers should be applied to metadata and datasets so that they can be findable and referenced in a reliable and efficient manner. Using DOI also ensures that citations and reuse can be tracked. A certified data repository will often provide this to (meta)data deposited there.

#### [FAIRsFAIR - sufficiently addressed](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088215) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

[Will the material receive a persistent identifier (PID), and what type of PID? Enter the PID here if you have one, or when you get one.]
**Why is this important?**
A persistent identifier is a unique digital ID that refers to one or more objects, digital or physical. In research, it’s common practise to issue a PID to publications or research data that are preserved for a long time and made accessible through digital resources.
It’s important to enter this information to show funders that you have thought about essential factors around the access to data. As there are different types of PID, depending on e.g. field of research or where the data material is preserved, you may want to explore which PID is most suited for your material. Data that are made accessible through SND receive a persistent identifier called a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

#### [NTNU - DMP Guidance](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
Persistent identifiers like DOIs are usually issued by data repositories (e.g., Zenodo, NTNU Open Research Data etc.). In most cases, your choice of repository will therefore determine the use of persistent identifiers.
