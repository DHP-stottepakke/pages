## 3a - How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research process?

<!--key information-->
### [Science Europe DMP Guidance](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862 "Science Europe. (2021). Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management - Extended Edition. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915862") [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - annotated

> 3a.1\
Describe where the data will be stored and backed up during research activities and how often the backup will be performed. It is recommended to store data in least at two separate locations.

> 3a.2\
Give preference to the use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup, such as provided by IT support services of the home institution. Storing data on laptops, stand-alone hard drives, or external storage devices such as USB sticks is not recommended.

Information about backup routines for all chosen storage solutions should be provided by the IT department. In cases were institutionally managed storage cannot be used (e.g. field trips), the 3-2-1 rule should be followed (at least 3 copies of the data, 2 different media, 1 off-site copy).

#### Sufficiently adressed (DMP Evaluation Rubric)
Clearly (even if briefly) describes:
- The location where the data and backups will be stored during the research activities.
- How often backups will be performed.
- The use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup (for example storage provided by the home institution).
or
- Explains why institutional storage will not be used (and for what part of the data) and describes the (additional) locations, storage media, and procedures that will be used for storing and backing up data during the project.

<!--additional explanations-->
### Explanations for support staff
- Where to find information about local & national computing infrastructure, when to use what.
- Technical knowledge of backup approaches.

#### [Guidance from NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/)
[Storage and data security during the project]\
- Where will (meta)data be stored and backed up throughout the project, and how often will this be performed? Storing data on laptops, typical external hard drives, USB-sticks or similar is not recommended due to less protection and greater risk of data being lost.
- How should data be recovered in the event of an accident?

Where will your data be stored, and how will the data be backed up? Describe where you will store and back up your data during your research project. Consider who will be responsible for backup and recovery. If there are several researchers involved, create a plan with your collaborators and ensure safe transfer between participants. Show that you are aware of the storing solutions provided by your organisation. Do not merely refer to IT services. In the end, you are responsible for your data, not the IT department or the organisation. Explain the methods for preserving and sharing your data after your research project has ended in more detail in Section 5. 
Tips for best practices
- The use of a safe and secure storage provided and maintained by your organisation’s IT support or other reliable IT provider such as CSC is preferable.
- Do NOT USE external hard drives as the main storing option.
- Follow your institution's data security requirements

#### [NTNU - DMP guidance](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
- Describe where your data will be stored during the project period. We recommend using NTNU’s standard storage solutions (see NTNU storage guide). For specific information about procedures for back-up for the solution you choose for your project, contact the IT support at NTNU.
- Storing data on laptops, external hard drives, or external storage devices such as USB sticks is not recommended. Be sure to consider information security as well as data integrity and accessibility.

#### [UiT - DMP guidance](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=726373)
- What are the procedures for storage and backup, and where will this be done?
- Who is responsible for backup and restoring the data?
(For projects run exclusively at UiT, this will be the UiT IT Department for, provided that UiT facilities are used for storage.)
- Do you have sufficient storage facilities, or do you need extra services?
If collecting data in the field (out of office), how will the data be safely transferred from the field to the main storage unit?
- What kind of folder structure and filename conventions will be used?
- If collecting data in the field (out of office), how will the data be safely transferred from the field to the main storage unit?

Where and how will the data material be stored, and how do you make sure that it is securely stored? Will you do regular backups of the files? How will the data be recovered in the event of an incident? 
**Why is this important? **
Losing a data material is something you want to avoid. Secure storage with regular backups of the data is essential. You may want to consult with the university’s/organization’s IT security office about storage and backups before you begin the data collection/project.]

Explain how the data will be recovered in the event of an incident.

> 3b.2\
Explain who will have access to the data during the research and how access to data is controlled, especially in collaborative partnerships.

> 3b.3\
Consider data protection, particularly if your data is sensitive for example containing personal data, politically sensitive information, or trade secrets. Describe the main risks and how these will be managed.

> 3b.4\
Explain which institutional data protection policies are in place.

What legal issues are related to your data management? (For example, GDPR and other legislation affecting data processing).
All types of research data involve questions of rights and legal and ethical issues. Demonstrate that you are aware of the relevant legislation related to your data processing. If you are handling personal or sensitive information, describe how you will ensure privacy protection and data anonymisation or pseudonymisation.
- Tips for best practices:
- Check your institutional ethical guidelines, data privacy guidelines and data security policy, and prepare to follow the instructions that are given in these guidelines.
- If your research is to be reviewed by an ethical committee, outline in your DMP how you will comply with the protocol (e.g., how you will remove personal or sensitive information from your data before sharing data to ensure privacy protection).
- Will you process personal data? If you intend to do so, please detail what type of personal data you will collect.
- All data related to an identified or identifiable person is personal data. Information such as names, telephone numbers, location data and information on the congenital diseases of the individual's grandparents is personal data.

#### [NTNU - DMP Guidance](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/DMP+guidance)
Note that all data should be classified in order to choose the correct level of security and confidentiality. See Innsida for more information on how to classify research data. Also see [Sikresiden.no](https://www.sikresiden.no/en/preventive/securinginformation) for more information about information security.

#### [UiT - DMP guidance](https://en.uit.no/research/research-dataportal/art?p_document_id=726373)
Does your data include sensitive data? (If yes, also answer the questions below.) 
Are you going to collect informed consent to store and share the data? If so, how? 
How are you going to secure confidentiality and identity protection?

#### [SND - Checklist DMP](https://zenodo.org/records/6424769)[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
Refer to the information security guidelines and policies in your university/organization and define what implications they have. What information classification level does the data material have and what security measures are needed to protect the material? Who should have access to the project data during the project and how do you plan to protect the data from unauthorised access?
**Why is this important?** Access to the data material must be restricted so that authorised people can access it, but it is protected from unauthorised access. Secure work and storage environments can include access restriction (e.g. passwords), encryption, and virus and access protection. You may need to contact your organization’s IT security office to make sure that you have addressed all questions regarding information security before the data collection begins.]
